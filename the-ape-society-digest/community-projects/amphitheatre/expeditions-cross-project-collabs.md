# Expeditions (Cross Project Collabs)

After Phase 4 is completed and the builders of the Amphitheatre have established an efficient development process for integrating custom gear, the Amphitheatre will open its doors to collaborations with other Cardano NFT projects/collections. These collaborations will be called "Expeditions". Expeditions will be an event that rewards the winner (Explorer class ape) with a mythical item .&#x20;

Update 6/26/2023 - We have been in discussions with fellow community members and there might be different ways to earn Mythical gear from expeditions in the future via more interative means. More to come.

### Amphitheatre Expedition objectives

1. **Provide unique Amphitheatre utility for Explorers**\
   The Amphitheatre will provide unique utility for each class of Ape in the Ape Society. Expeditions will be where the Explorer class shines.
2. **Additional utility for SOCIETY while giving apes more opportunities via bounties.**\
   In the future, the Amphitheatre will provide a mechanism for collaborative projects to fund an "Expedition" for their project with SOCIETY. The cost to fund an expedition will be enough to cover item development costs such as writing, 3d modeling, and in-game/in-dApp QA [bounties ](bounty-structure.md)for an Expedition mythical item.&#x20;
3. **Provide participating projects with fresh interest and buyer demand.**\
   In this competitive market, projects need to find unique ways to stand out. By funding an expedition, a project will not only gain a spotlight in the TAS community, but apes who want a chance at receiving top tier gear will have to buy and hold said project/collection (hold to earn utility) for a specified number of Epochs to be eligible for the airdrop from each Expedition.&#x20;

Projects can and are encouraged to fund multiple expeditions (multiple items). But why would they want to?&#x20;

* There will be "gear set" stat bonuses in the Amphitheatre when an ape equips Expedition items from the same collab/project policyid in their Amphitheatre loadout.
* The more expeditions a project/collection funds, the more Epochs their projects will be subject to the hold to earn benefits of Expeditions. (see Apr 2022 market stats on Ape Society to get an idea of what kind of effect this can have on your project)
* Possibly an incentivized Expedition tier structure based on how many Expeditions a project funds.

Clarification: Funding an "Expedition" is an entirely different mechanic than an Ape funding a blueprints/crafting system. Expedition gear cannot be crafted by craftsmen. There will only ever be 1 item per expedition.

The airdrop mechanism will comprise of a weighted random function that will be scored (details to come later) via wallet content snapshots during an Expedition. This will establish gamified hold to earn mechanics by holding participating projects.

Also, to help prevent market manipulation, after a variety of different projects have established Expeditions, there **will not** be a predetermined "schedule" of expeditions. Each funded and prepped expedition will be thrown into a "pool" of expeditions to be chosen before that expedition starts. The selection process will be random and will be as transparent and publicly available as possible to maximize fairness (maybe livestreamed).

This Expedition overview contains more detail than the following references, but brief mentions on Expeditions and Mythical gear can be found in the [Bounty Structure](sponsorship-structure.md#discovering-legendary-gear) and [Original Proposal.](original-proposal.md#explorers)



We're still early in the ideation phase. Details on this page concerning Expeditions are subject to change.
