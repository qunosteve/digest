# Expeditions (Cross Project Collabs)

After Phase 4 is completed and the builders of the Amphitheatre have established an efficient development process for integrating custom gear, the Amphitheatre will open its doors to collaborations with other Cardano NFT projects/collections. These collaborations will be called "Expeditions". Expeditions will be an event that rewards the winner (Explorer class ape) with a mythical item .&#x20;

Update 6/26/2023 - We have been in discussions with fellow community members concerning different and exciting ways to earn Mythical gear from expeditions in the future via more interative means. Will elaborate as get closer to Phase 5 when we are able to dedicate resources.

### Amphitheatre Expedition objectives

1. **Provide unique Amphitheatre utility for Explorers**\
   The Amphitheatre will provide unique utility for each class of Ape in the Ape Society. Expeditions will be where the Explorer class shines.
2. **Additional utility for SOCIETY while giving apes more opportunities via bounties.**\
   In the future, the Amphitheatre will provide a mechanism for collaborative projects to fund an "Expedition" for their project with SOCIETY. The cost to fund an expedition will be enough to cover item development costs such as writing, 3d modeling, and in-game/in-dApp QA [bounties ](bounty-structure.md)for an Expedition mythical item.&#x20;
3. **Provide participating projects with fresh interest and buyer demand.**\
   In this competitive market, projects need to find unique ways to stand out. By funding an expedition, a project will not only gain a spotlight in the TAS community, but apes who want a chance at receiving top tier gear will have to buy and hold said project/collection (hold to earn utility) for a specified number of Epochs to be eligible for the airdrop from each Expedition.&#x20;

Projects can and are encouraged to fund multiple expeditions (multiple items). But why would they want to?&#x20;

* There will be "gear set" stat bonuses in the Amphitheatre when an ape equips Expedition items from the same collab/project policyid in their Amphitheatre loadout.
* The more expeditions a project/collection funds, the more Epochs their projects will be subject to the hold to earn or interact benefits of Expeditions. (see Apr 2022 market stats on Ape Society to get an idea of what kind of effect this can have on your project)
* Possibly an incentivized Expedition tier structure based on how many Expeditions a project funds.

Clarification: Funding an "Expedition" is an entirely different mechanic than an Ape funding a blueprints/crafting system. The exact mechanism is not set it stone yet.

This Expedition overview contains more detail than the following references, but brief mentions on Expeditions and Mythical gear can be found in the [Bounty Structure](sponsorship-structure.md#discovering-legendary-gear) and [Original Proposal.](original-proposal.md#explorers)

We're still early in the ideation phase. Details on this page concerning Expeditions are subject to change.
