# Mithril Deflector (Metal shield)

This round and light shield is the perfect companion when wielding a one-handed item. Having a Mithril core covered in titanium, it is extremely rare to see this shield on the battlefield as most craftsmen cannot get the raw materials even if they possess the blueprints.

What is known of the origin of the blueprints is that this was an early alien relic. The use case for the shield was probably not as a defense piece in battle, but rather as an enhancement of sorts for the alien crafts. The shield along with the blueprints was originally found by a De Balboa explorer who was mapping the northern most parts of Lanurk. In a wooded area that was extremely inaccessible, a concrete bunker was discovered. Searching the bunker not much more were found than a table with three shields and the blueprints.

When testing the shield for hardness and durability it was quickly clear that this was extremely well made. Shooting arrows directly on the shield would damage even the hardest bolt tip yet leave no mark in the Mithril. The weight of the shield was another advantage. Ultralight and movable, it was quick to lift to avoid incoming bolts and arrows as well as sword blows.

Several craftsmen across society have access to the blueprints, but very few can procure the elusive Mithril metal. No one really knows who the sellers are, or where they get the Mithril, but it does surface from time to time. When it does, apes with deep pockets are quick to bid a good amount of $SOCIETY to get their hands on this magnificent piece of armor.

In appearance, the shield is completely round with two metal circles. The outer circle is a mix between Titanium and Mitril, while the center circle is pure Mithril. The inner circle is clear grey and shines like a mirror while the outer circle is a duller color of grey.
