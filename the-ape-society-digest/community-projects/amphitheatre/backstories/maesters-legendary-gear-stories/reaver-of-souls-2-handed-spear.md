# Reaver of Souls (2 handed spear)

Is magic real? Can weapons be enchanted? Who knows for sure. What we do know is that many apes believe this particular two-handed spear to have some rather nasty side effects besides death.

The great hall of arcane research in Tasama City issued this rather peculiar weapon on the market. This two-handed spear measures 7 feet in total length. Its shaft is a long black piece of ebony wood with a pommel shaped with a copper pentagram. The head looks to be secured to the shaft by a golden band and is made of sharpened white bone. The rumors would have it that the mighty De\`Medici family long have been researching ways to capture dead souls in necromancy rituals. Any poor ape that would meet his bane would not be able to rest in peace but would be trapped in death by some sort of dark magic.

Having said that, other apes are pretty certain that this weapon is some sort of practical joke conjured up by a noble with too much time on his hand.

So, the conclusion is that no one really knows if this is the harbinger of eternal death, or just an ornate regular two-handed spear. The myth has been so ingrained in the wider ape society that the shear sight of this spear on the battlefield will make the opponent question whether it is a prudent move to attack that particular ape with the spear.

Apart from scaring the opponent hapless, the spear in itself is an excellent defense against cavalry charges. The long pole can easily stop both horse and rider should there be a coordinated charge.

In major battles it is very common to see at least one of these spears as demoralization of opponents is a great trick whether the spear reaves souls or not.
