# B0038 - CRPG Experience

* I found the connection to Steam via the website actually pretty straight forward, as it was just a case of logging in to my account (users who don't have steam or not familiar with it may find it a bit more complicated)&#x20;
* The MOD download was easy. The bit that may confuse people is when you have to select the right mod before playing (see example attached).
* ![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1).png>)
* A few features I found on the website which I think could really improve the UI, as it does feel a bit 'clunky' are
* Equipping Weapons and Armor - wasn't an obvious thing, you have to click and drag them into the correct placement and as someone who had just started took me a while to figure out, a solution would be a simple equip/unequip button.
* Characteristic menu - now this area for me was super confusing, as I had no idea what skill points to use where, i didn't even know what the skill points were being used for and which ones would benefit my character. I think a solution to this would be some example builds of each class (melee, two handed, polearm, ranged etc) that users can see as a good guide in where to put their points. or even pre-set default classes/builds to really help newcomers and the UI.
* Icons - for me the icons when looking at weapons/armor could really do with having a worded icon that physically says one handed or two handed etc, as a new user you're not familiar with all these icons so a mixture of both would be good. I will of course give as much feedback as I can over the next few days, but it didn't take me long to understand, I've been playing on their server for 2 days now and seem to understand a decent amount.

This whole page was confusing to me at first, with no information on how to spend your points:\

Inserting an equip button might be useful for newer users. As well as a simple tutorial:\
![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (10).png>)\


Thinking about it, it would be great to have a visual bar that goes up when you spend your attribute points, itâ€™s great having numbers but something you can physically watch go up, and you can compare them to default builds. Think that would be a nice touch \


Apparently there's a Strat (global map) and it is under development at the moment that's where players could choose their teammates, unsure of a timeline with that though, There is a way of doing tournaments like 6x6s so its definitely possible to be able to restrict players for high prized events or for whitelists (might take a while if theres only 6x6) \


There is also a duel EU server but it isn't very popular (apparently little reward, I had to ask for them to put it on) but i guess we could change that and could be a good way to settle who the winner is)

I think in terms of features that could be used to tie in with CIP-68 assets, we're obviously looking at something you can upgrade, and since you've got the weapons and armor blueprints sorted, I think it would have to be something else.&#x20;

Unless you wanted to base it on armor you could have your assets level up as you play and change color for example everyone starts out with standard amour and as you level up they work through silver, gold, platinum etc. Might be a cool way to show off your commitment and skills in game and others can physically see you look badass!
