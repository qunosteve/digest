# Frames

Frames are upgradeable in-cabin assets used to stake apes and other NFTs. There are currently 7 level of frames, each level rewards more $SOCIETY than the previous level. The **only** way to purchase frames is with $SOCIETY. The infographic below has all the information about frames cost and upgrades

Apes can be staked in frames to earn society, but non-ape NFTs can also be staked to earn society. When an ape is staked, they start earning society from level 0, however a non-ape NFT only starts to earn society on level 1 frames.&#x20;

A few examples of staking:

* You can stake a craftsman ape (1x base staking) in a level 4 frame (1x multiplier) and earn in total 2x the rewards. Assuming the base staking rate is 50society/day, your NFT will earn you 100 society/day
* You can stake a non-ape NFT (no base staking rate) in a level 2 frame (0.2x multiplier) and earn 0.2x the rewards. Assuming the base staking rate is 50society/day, your NFT will earn you 10 society per day
