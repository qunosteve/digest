## Emission Schedule

The emissions schedule is a schedule tailor fit for staking. Apes that are staked will emit society according to the curve below. The emissions will start at point 1, it will rise until it peaks at point 2, before it sharply declines until point 3, and then will steadily go down until it hits a steady state value for the rest of time.&#x20;

The timeline for the curve is unknown to prevent participants from gaming the system
