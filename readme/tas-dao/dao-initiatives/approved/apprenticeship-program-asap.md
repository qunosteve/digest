# Apprenticeship Program (ASAP)

## ASAP - The Ape Society Apprenticeship Program

Note (as of July 25, 2023): This proposal was approved before Aiken and might need a revision. Also, since the DAO funds were frozen during the timeline, the timelines will need to be adjusted as well.

### Description (please be thorough):&#x20;

To increase the depth of current and future Ape Society talent, we propose the establishment of an "Apprenticeship" program of TAS-borne Smart Contract developers. These individuals would be sent to a Haskell/Plutus course funded by the DAO, then they would "pay back via time and service" to the Ape Society by serving in a 6-month part-time internship under AF1 to help build The Ape Society roadmap and/or community-led initiatives (if directed by AF1).

To achieve this competitive edge, we have selected and have been in contact with EMURGO as our educational facilitator. As the official commercial arm and a founding entity of the Cardano blockchain, EMURGO is uniquely positioned to leverage its extensive knowledge of Cardano’s technical development to offer curated educational courses on Cardano. EMURGO Academy, EMURGO’s education unit, has tentatively agreed, pending this proposal’s passing, to permit a small cohort of aspiring TAS developers into one of its upcoming Vasil Hard Fork Green Shoots Developer Professional Program batches. &#x20;

The program will be targeted for individuals with proficiency in any programming language and who are comfortable with building working applications. The TAS learner, after completion of the program, will be able to understand various features of the Cardano Blockchain platform, gain proficiency in Haskell programming, understand its pertinence to Cardano smart contracts and be proficient in smart contract development on Cardano using Plutus.

Upon successful passage of this proposal through the DAO process, an application process for TAS members desiring consideration will be determined at a later time.

### &#x20;Benefits to DAO & Individual Members:

#### DAO Benefits

The DAO, Individual Ape and/or Cabin holders will benefit through equipping AF1 with "home-grown" development talent to supplement AF1's existing team to execute on the roadmap strategy. This program will instill even greater confidence an investment in a TAS asset will hold long-term value, and potentially even increased engagement of TAS fans not fortunate enough to hold OG assets. While the strength of current community-led initiatives (such as the Amphitheatre) is apparent, in order to reduce the uncertainty of talent that we "might have" in the community to help build these ambitious proposals, we can use this program to help to ensure that the community has the right developers to accelerate the build out of these initiatives. We want to grow and develop our own talent in TAS. Essentially, the initial (roughly $1000 USD per apprentice) investment could bring back huge return on investment to the TAS ecosystem via innovation and development.

#### Individual Members Benefits

Individuals who are selected by the TAS DAO to be an "Apprentice" will have an opportunity at supplementing their existing career or build a new one in a lucrative field such as smart contract programming. By sending these individuals to the EMURGO Vasil Hard Fork Green Shoots course ([https://emurgo.io/emurgo-academy-special-offer-on-cardano-courses/](https://emurgo.io/emurgo-academy-special-offer-on-cardano-courses/)), they will participate in instructor-led lectures, evaluations, screenings, post-training support and guidance to ensure learners stay updated with the latest version/release. After the course, the 6 month internship with TAS will allow them to gain real world experience in the material. After the internship, the apprentice should then be well-equipped to take on the world of smart contract programming and innovate on the Cardano blockchain.

The Ape Society is distinguished. It is world-class. Everything we produce, including our talent, must be so as well.&#x20;



### Risks and Concerns:

#### Failure

To mitigate the risk of aspiring TAS developers failing to complete the program or defaulting on their service obligation, students will be required to hold an equivalent value of NFTs in escrow. Students who successfully fulfill the terms of their service will get their collateral back. The method of collateralizing an advance will be determined later but may include a lending pool contract to facilitate the terms.

#### Collateral

Because the Cardano blockchain advocates for growing the global Cardano community by banking the unbanked and giving economic identity to those who don't have it, the DAO will reserve the right, either through proposal or will, to sponsor individuals who demonstrate tremendous potential but who currently lack the ability to meet the collateral requirements for participation in ASAP.

#### Anonymity

Participants may want to register with EMURGO using their real names while maintaining anonymity online. Steps can be taken to protect anonymity but cannot be guaranteed.

### Cost

The cost of this investment is a discounted rate of 960 USD, \~2133 ADA per student at the time of this writing. This program tuition cost, initially covered by the TAS DAO, would be paid back to the DAO in full in exchange of a negotiable 6 month service obligation to the development of the Ape Society roadmap.

Initial ASAP Cohort – 3 individuals; or \~6400 ADA to be earned back to the DAO in full (maybe through a bounty system) estimated to take \~6 months of service obligation to TAS roadmap objectives.&#x20;



### Timeline/Roadmap

Depending on the approval timeline, participants will begin in one of three upcoming batches in the next 3 months.\
