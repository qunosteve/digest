# DAO Constitution

The Ape council is a subsidiary of The Ape Society DAO that will oversee proposals voting, implementation, and funding. To achieve this, we must address the governance structure and a revamped voting structure for proposals:

## Governance Structure (council, etc)

### Council Members

* There will be a minimum of 11 council members\
  &#x20;
* Each applicant to the council member role must satisfy the eligibility requirements:
  1. Must be at least level 15 on discord or
  2. Must be endorsed by 3 member apes that are at least level 15 on discord\

* AF1 will screen applicants to ensure they meet eligibility requirements. (Council members cannot assume this role for they need to remain neutral in the council selection process)\

* Each applicant must then submit a short text on why they should be chosen for the role. Mainly to use as an ad for apes to vote for them.\

* Applicants are put to vote where all verified apes vote, and the top 11 applicants are selected\

* This process repeats every 4 months, with both potential council members and existing council members putting their applications through for a vote.\

* A 6/11 majority will be needed to approve DAO spending, whereas a 5/11 majority is needed for council decisions\

* Once voted on, Council members responsibilities will include:
  1. Facilitate proposal voting through setting up proposals for vote
  2. Be part of multisig transaction for spending dao funds
  3. Representation of the DAO through different initiatives
  4. Setting up channels and checking in on passed proposals/committees formed
  5. Fostering DAO engagement and growth\

* Each council member will have a unique role, or a shared role with other members. Roles can include but are not limited to:
  1. Gathering proposal data from forms
  2. Posting proposal to channel
  3. Counting votes and vote percentages
  4. Organising council voting
  5. Setting up committees and channels\
     \

* There will be a 2-week max transition period to educate newly selected council members by out-going members. In that time period, newly elected council members are shown the ropes and educated until they are comfortable with assuming their roles.

### Council Chair Ape

* Selected by council members through nominations and voting\

* Council chair is voted for/re-elected every 4 months (if there is a change in council members). This will be an internal vote by council members.\

* Council chair responsibilities include:
  1. Being the conduit between AF1 and the DAO
  2. Is the tie-breaker for when there is a split due to the absence of a council member (they effectively then have 2 votes only in that circumstance)
  3. Be the face of the council
  4. Lead the council members team, organise meetings and ensure smooth running of the DAO process

### Council Vice ChairApe

* Must be a council member selected by the council chair\

* Is there to fill in for the council chair when they are unable to manage their responsibilities due to extenuating circumstances, or if a vote of no confidence is called and passed on the ChairApe. \


### Vote of no confidence

* A vote of no confidence can be called by any ape to eject a fellow council member either caught in a malicious act, failing to adhere to responsibilities, or is entirely inactive. This also includes the chair. If the majority of the council votes to oust the council member, their spot will remain vacant until the next council election. In the meantime, the council chair assumes their vote. \


### Special Member&#x20;

(Anti-corruption measure to be implemented through a separate proposal at a later point)

* In the case of a corrupt majority council, there needs to be a way to by-pass council oversight for proposals pertaining to council members. A special member will be appointed by Apes who alone has the power to draft proposals against council member actions without having the proposal go through council. This is a fail safe measure to ensure the council as a whole is kept honest and accountable.&#x20;

### DAO Voting Structure

* Only verified apes will be allowed to submit a proposal, along with two co-signers\

* Voting will occur in one or two stages depending on the outcome of the initial vote\

* Council members screen proposals before putting them to initial vote. Any council member can flag a proposal and veto it if the majority of council members agree to veto. Reasons must be given to proposer\

* If a proposal passes screening to initial vote, and carries a greater than 75% positive response, council members can immediately pass the proposal without 2nd stage voting and move to implement it\

* If the initial vote is less than 75% but greater than 50%, a second voting stage ensues with member apes. In the second stage at least 60% of apes must vote yes for the proposal to pass.\

* Lastly if the initial voting stage is below 50% approval, the proposal must be re-written and re-submitted\

* In the event of any extreme circumstances surrounding the authenticity of the voting process or otherwise, council members in conjunction with AF1 can vote to veto a proposal and alert the community on reasons why\


### Proposal Workflow Process &#x20;

* Apes write a proposal and submit it via form already in place.
* Submitted proposals are posted in a proposal review channel by a council member&#x20;
* Allow 48 hours for proposals to sit in that channel. If a council member reacts with an X on a proposal, we will convene to discuss a veto on the proposal and a vote will ensue&#x20;
* If no one reacts after 24 hours, a council member will add a checkmark to the proposal and move the proposal to the initial voting stage&#x20;
* Initial vote happens, discussions are had. After 48 hours, a council member checks to see if initial vote satisfies >75% positive reaction (out all apes that have reacted). Otherwise if the initial vote sees > 50% positive reaction, a council member will move the vote to second stage voting and allow 48 hours for second voting. A greater than 60% vote is needed to pass a proposal&#x20;
* If a proposal passes vote (first or second stage), a council member adds the proposal to passed proposals channel and a committee is formed by a council member where proposal submitter and co-signers are added to the channel&#x20;
* The passed proposals channel will have a funded reaction. After every funding (6/9 signatures on dao wallet). A funded reaction will be put on the proposal in question in the passed proposals channel by a council member&#x20;

### Tasks and responsibilities for council members

* A council member needs to move proposal from submission to review channel, properly formatted&#x20;
* A council member needs to move proposal from review channel to initial vote stage&#x20;
* A council member needs to check vote percentages (this will need some oversight so I suggest more than one person do this, might need a system where council members need a cosigner for vote checks)&#x20;
* A council member needs to create either a second vote stage via voting bot or create a channel for proposal members (if more than 75% approval in initial vote)&#x20;
* A council member needs to post proposal link and funding status in passed proposals page&#x20;
* A council member needs to change funding status once completed.
* Members should be able to commit to a minimum of one meeting per week when organised for Council business
