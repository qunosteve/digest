# Bounty Structure

[Click here ](https://discord.com/channels/1008361097553776743/1020505851225702450)to access to the current posted bounties.

## **Purpose**

Building the Amphitheatre landmark will require the collective effort and teamwork of people from many different skillsets. This document outlines the different disciplines, progression systems, and reward structures in place to make building this project rewarding, competitive, and fun. Finding the right balance of competitiveness, teamwork, and satisfaction is important to attract and retain talent in the decentralized and transparent world we are building. We believe the program detailed in this document will be a leading example, or “tip of the spear”, in decentralized teamwork and innovation.

The primary mission of The Amphitheatre Builder’s Bounty Program is to honor and reward the dedicated community members of the Ape Society who contribute to building the Amphitheatre landmark. The primary method of reward will be the issuance of “certificates” that will serve as immutable, on-chain “proof” that a person has contributed the project and how. These certificates will introduce a novel way for a person to showcase their skills in a web3 world. The use case will be more apparent when Ape Society cabins are released where you can frame your non fungible tokens on display inside of Cabin picture frames.

Implementing a method to reimburse the participants’ operating costs will help in supporting the sustainability and talent retention of the project. To achieve this, some bounties in this program will award recipients with $SOCIETY token, the Ape Society’s ecosystem token. Operating costs could include but are not limited to: internet service provider data usage, computer software and hardware costs, education and training costs, blockchain transaction fee costs when testing, book and media (writers’ inspiration) rental costs, and/or rising energy costs when undergoing heavy 3d rendering of assets. At time of this writing, the amount of $SOCIETY issued for each bounty has been calibrated to avoid unreasonably exorbitant payouts at its current value, while also giving enough cushion to absorb the price volatility of the token and the fees incurred while transferring tokens.

## **Disclaimer**

This project makes no representations regarding the tax consequences of the payments that are made under this structure. Participants in this program are responsible for any tax liability associated with bounty award payments they receive. Also, this project is neither funded nor ran by the Ape Society DAO or development team; this is purely a community led project to enrich the participation and immersion in the Ape Society ecosystem.

## **Prerequisites**

To help encourage the understanding of the utility of the $SOCIETY token awarded in the bounties, the recipients of these bounties must demonstrate proof of ownership of an Ape Society asset. On bounty completion, the recipient will name the eligible asset they own, and the rewards/certificate will go to that asset.\
\
If the contributor of the bounty cannot afford/does not own one of these assets, they can coordinate with an Ape Society community member as a "proxy" to fulfill the bounty. The certificates/rewards will go to that Ape holder and anything beyond that (how the rewards are distributed) will have be worked out between the proxy and the contributor.&#x20;

### **Mercenary Bounties**

To participate in the basic level of earning potential, all you need is to hold an Ape Society cabin or a COTAS Passport, as this demonstrates a level of commitment to the ecosystem.&#x20;

### **Domain-focused Bounties & Certificates**

Specialized bounties will allow participants to enter a progression system to unlock greater earning potential and perks. As these bounties will require an Ape’s Name, a participant must hold an Ape Society ape in their wallet to receive these specialized certificates and rewards.

### **Special Certificates**

As of this moment, for special non-bounty associated Certificates, a recipient must hold an Ape Society ape to receive the “Special” certificates that are outlined in this document.

## **The Stewardship**

The Stewards of the Amphitheatre are a group of members who are charged with the following responsibilities:

* Strategic governance and oversight
* Managing budgets
* Posting, Evaluating, and awarding Bounties in their Domain
* Other administrative responsibilities as needed

### **Stewardship Seats**

There are 5 seats in the Stewardship. Here are their roles and responsibilities.

* Grand Architect – Overseer of the project. Charged with implementing the vision and spirit of the Proposal that was popularized by the community. When a seat is empty, the Architect assumes that seat’s responsibilities.
* Grand Maester – Responsible for the recordkeeping and social media accounts of the Amphitheatre. Posts and evaluates bounties in the writing and lore domain.
* Grand Artisan – Responsible for the technical development and implementation of the Amphitheatre. Also responsible for posting/evaluating bounties in the technical domain.
* Grand Maestro – Responsible for the style, 3d and 2d assets, and music of the Amphitheatre and posting/evaluating the artists’ bounties.
* Grand Inquisitor – Responsible for the integrity of the Amphitheatre (seeking out exploits/bugs in the game/dApp and achieving optimal game balance) and its domain’s bounties. Also responsible for industry research.

The first cohort of Stewards will be appointed by the Grand Architect. The responsibilities of these seats are subject to change as the project moves along and adaptations are needed. Non-Mercenary Certificates (including Sponsors) will to be used as governance tokens to vote on future candidates when participants achieve the “expert” level achievement in their domain.

Each appointed Steward will see his Ape listed in the Maester\`s annals. Along with the listing, date of initiation, and date of resignation, the backstory of the Ape will be written and linked in the annals. Along with the Apes name, the discord or twitter handle of the person behind the Ape will also be listed as a merit.

### **Compensation**

Members of the stewardship are not paid a salary while the project is underway. They can fulfil bounties, but those must be evaluated by the other stewards. If the project is successful, and if there are any funds that remain in the Amphitheatre wallet, there can be a vote by the TAS community or the certificate holders to determine if and how much $SOCIETY stewards will be paid.

## **Rewards Structure**

### **Summary**

The rewards structure is the core of this document that will make sense of all the other sections. The Amphitheatre’s Builder’s Bounty Program will be split up into 2 types of reward structures:

* Mercenary
* Domain-specific

For each bounty completed, TAS Apes can chose to earn Mercenary rewards or Domain-specific rewards. Cabin owners can only participate in Mercenary rewards.

### **Mercenary Rewards**

Upon the completion of a Bounty, a Cabin, Ape, or COTAS owner can choose to be rewarded with the following. This reward is sent to a recipient’s wallet where that asset resides:

* 1000 $SOCIETY.

### **Domain-specific Rewards**

Each domain (Artisan, Maestro, Inquisitor, and Maester) has their own independent progression system. These progression systems are exclusive to ape holders. Each domain is structured into 3 tiers:

* **Recruit**
* **Veteran**
* **Expert**

### **Recruits**

If an ape chooses the domain-specific reward, they start at the Recruit level. For every bounty they complete at the recruit level here are the rewards:

* Recruit Level Certificate with their Ape’s Name
* 1000 Blueprint Tokens
* After an ape Acquires 5 Recruit Level Certificates in a domain, an Ape earns the privilege to begin earning “Veteran” level rewards in that Domain. In addition, to celebrate that Ape’s graduation, the Grand Architect will use Amphitheatre funds to craft an item of the graduate’s choice of up to an Exalted level blueprint (when crafting becomes operational) as a graduation gift.

### **Veterans**

If an ape completes a bounty, has graduated from that domain’s recruit level, and chooses that domain’s specific reward, they will receive the following rewards:

* Veteran Level Certificate with their Ape’s Name
* Their selection of 1 form of compensation (per veteran certificate): 2000 $SOCIETY or 2500 Blueprint Tokens
* After an ape Acquires 20 Veteran Level Certificates in a domain, an Ape earns the privilege to begin earning “Expert” level rewards in that domain. In addition, to celebrate that Ape’s promotion, the Grand Architect will use Amphitheatre funds to craft an item of the promotee’s choice of up to a Majestic level blueprint (when crafting becomes operational) as a promotion gift.

### **Experts**

If an ape completes a bounty, has been promoted from that domain’s veteran level, and chooses that domain’s specific reward, they will receive the following rewards:

* Expert Level Certificate with their Ape’s Name
* Their selection of 1 form of compensation (per expert certificate): 3000 $SOCIETY Or 4000 Blueprint Token
* After an ape Acquires 1 expert level certificate in a domain, an Ape earns the privilege to invoke an election for that domain’s stewardship seat.

### **Teamwork**

Apes can form teams of up to 3 to complete a bounty. Each ape will receive their desired certificate, but $SOCIETY payouts will be split in proportion to how many team members participate. For example, 2 veterans and an expert complete a bounty. They all get a certificate, but the veterans only earn 667 $SOCIETY each and the expert only earns 1000 $SOCIETY.

\*Due to the complexity of keeping track of blueprint credit, bounties issued to more than 1 ape will not count towards blueprint credit. For bounties issued to more than one Ape, the $SOCIETY payouts must be chosen.

### **Conservation**

After the sponsorships from the family competitions start to trickle in and we gain some certainty on how much $SOCIETY will be raised, we will do some mathematical projections and establish the conditions for the Stages below. This staged mechanism is inspired by water conservation management techniques in parts of the world where water supply is low.

* Stage 0 Budget (Amphitheatre wallet has over X amount of Society) – All bounties paid at the base rate. All blueprint credit earned at the base rate.
* Stage 1 Budget (Amphitheatre wallet has under X amount of Society) – All bounties paid at 50% of the base rate. All blueprint credit earned at 150% base rate.
* Stage 2 Budget (Amphitheatre wallet has under half of X amount of Society) – All bounties pay 25% of the base rate. All blueprint credit earned at 200% base rate.
* Stage 3 Budget (if we’re broke) – No $SOCIETY left to pay. All blueprint credit earned at 250% base rate.

To help reduce the saturation of too many blueprints from the credit system, Apes who earn bounties can only choose 1 blueprint to “progress” per Ape’s name until a Supreme blueprint is reached. Please see the sponsor’s incentivization structure document to view the amount of SOCIETY it takes to unlock each blueprint tier.

We will peg our $SOCIETY payouts to the price fluctuations of frames as time goes on and AF1 adjusts. For example, if frames decrease in cost from 750 to 500 (33%), a 2000 payout will decrease to 1333.

## **Special Certificates**

Sometimes people go above and beyond outside the predefined structures that are laid out. These people have an innate ability to understand the big picture and can anticipate the direction of the project and take measures to help the Stewardship. These certificates reward these forward-thinking efforts and other efforts not defined in this document:

### **Architect’s Hero**

In every Phase of the Amphitheatre’s construction there will be opportunity to perform exemplary work. Architect’s Hero is an award for the Apes that bring the “x factor” to the team. Innovators who can operate as effective leaders belong in this category. Besides an Architect’s Hero certificate, here are their forms of compensation:

* The Grand Architect will use Amphitheatre funds to craft an item of the Hero’s choice of up to a Supreme level blueprint (when crafting becomes operational) as a gift to the Hero.
* A Hero earns the privilege to invoke an election for their certificate domain’s stewardship seat.

### **Armourers**

Armourers will be the focal point of testing the Amphitheatre. Certificates and payouts are planned for Armourers after a soon to be determined tour of duty.

### **Looking Forward**

More Special certificates to come as needs arise.

## **Complimentary perks**

As projects come into the Cardano space, they will seek to build a strong core. As a group, the builders behind the Amphitheatre will be a gold mine for new projects who are looking for both quality community members and people who can build.

As participants of the Amphitheatre project, you all embody the spirit of builders, visionaries, and the overall "tip of the spear" in Cardano and blockchain innovation. As more people catch on that holding an Amphitheatre certificate means proof and demonstration of a person’s real-world skill, they will start to use your certificates as a trustless and immutable beacon to identify who the real players are in this space.
