# Stewards

## Stewardship of the Amphitheatre

* The Stewards of the Amphitheatre are a group of community members who are charged with the following responsibilities:&#x20;
* Strategic governance and oversight
* Managing budgets&#x20;
* Posting, Evaluating, and awarding Bounties in their Domain&#x20;
* Other administrative responsibilities as needed&#x20;

### Stewardship Seats&#x20;

There are 5 seats in the Stewardship. Here are their roles and responsibilities.&#x20;

* Grand Architect – Overseer of the project. Charged with implementing the vision and spirit of the Proposal that was popularized by the community. When a seat is empty, the Architect assumes that seat’s responsibilities.&#x20;
* Grand Maester – Responsible for the recordkeeping and social media accounts of the Amphitheatre. Posts and evaluates bounties in the writing and lore domain.&#x20;
* Grand Artisan – Responsible for the technical development and implementation of the Amphitheatre. Also responsible for posting/evaluating bounties in the technical domain.&#x20;
* Grand Maestro – Responsible for the style, 3d and 2d assets, and music of the Amphitheatre and posting/evaluating the artists’ bounties.&#x20;
* Grand Inquisitor – Responsible for the integrity of the Amphitheatre (seeking out exploits/bugs in the game/dApp and achieving optimal game balance) and its domain’s bounties. Also responsible for industry research.&#x20;

The first cohort of Stewards will be appointed by the Grand Architect. The responsibilities of these seats are subject to change as the project moves along and adaptations are needed. Non-Mercenary Certificates (including Sponsors) will to be used as governance tokens to vote on future candidates when participants achieve the “expert” level achievement in their domain and if they choose to invoke an election.&#x20;

Each appointed Steward will see his Ape listed in the Maester\`s annals. Along with the listing, date of initiation, and date of resignation, the backstory of the Ape will be written and linked in the annals. Along with the Apes name, the discord or twitter handle of the person behind the Ape will also be listed as a merit.&#x20;

### Compensation&#x20;

Members of the stewardship are not paid a salary while the project is underway. They can fulfil bounties, but those must be evaluated by the other stewards. If the project is successful, and if there are any funds that remain in the Amphitheatre wallet, there can be a vote by the Amphitheatre governance group to determine if and how much $SOCIETY stewards will be paid.&#x20;

### Spending Accountability and Governance-Approved Motions

Every outgoing SOCIETY transaction the stewardship makes (both incoming sponsorships and outgoing bounty payouts) is logged in a transparent way for the community to audit in the "outgoing-society" channel in Amphitheatre discord. To keep our promise to sponsors intact, Stewards of the Amphitheatre are not authorized to commit the Amphitheatre wallet's $SOCIETY for anything other than Bounties unless a governance motion is passed. In the Amphitheatre discord, stakeholders (verified builders and community sponsors) of the Amphitheatre have access to the "governance" channel. This is where motions are announced for approval.&#x20;

### Additional Comments on Stewards&#x20;

Stewards of the Amphitheatre, who are authorized to commit bounty payouts from the Amphitheatre wallet, are merely charged with the stewardship of the Amphitheatre’s assets and do not consider the assets their own. The stewardship’s mission is to act in the spirit and for the betterment of the Ape Society Community. Although the Stewardship of the Amphitheatre seeks to maximize the utility and synergy with other TAS entities such as AF1 and the TAS DAO, in contrast to TAS DAO funded projects such as the Societas board game, the Amphitheatre has not been funded by the DAO and is its own independent, separate entity.
