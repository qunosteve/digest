# Chest Plate of Lightening Deception



This dark grey body armor is surprisingly light for its appearance. Looking like normal steel plate armor you would expect it to be a heavy and restrictive piece. This is highly deceptive as it grants the user great mobility as well as excellent protection from blunt and sharp impacts.&#x20;

The main ingredient for making this outstanding armor is pellets of stable element 115 isotopes. The pellets are poured into the cast of liquid steel to make the substance extremely malleable. The craftsman can then easily forge layers of leaf thin armor that are woven together. When quenching the armor something very strange happens. The layers expand and look bulky even though the steel is ultra- light. The added alloy 115 also renders the plate extremely hard making it very difficult to penetrate with brute force. Having this deceptive advantage on the battlefield has made this armor extremely desired by combatants.&#x20;

Although much sought after, this armor is unfortunately very rare. The only supplier of element 115 pellets is Florimond Brown. It is rumored that he has managed to set up a particle accelerator on the 3rd sub-basement in his Chateau on 110 Holly Hill, Doork East. He apparently is accelerating Calcium particles with synthesized Americium in some strange process to get the isotopes stable. No one knows what he needs the pellets for, but as he needs raw calcium, he sometimes is willing to trade a few pellets in exchange. Many have tried to offer Florimond large sums of $SOCIETY for his material, but they are generally met with a door slammed in their face or even verbal abuse.&#x20;

One very lucky craftsman was able to get his hand on as many as 15 pellets when he gifted Florimond a supreme version of the armor. In a rare event of affection, Florimond showed the craftsman the process of manufacturing the substance after making him swear he would not talk publicly about it. Florimond needed the armor for unknown purposes. The craftsman could unfortunately not replicate the process as it was dealing with extremely advanced physics. Thus, all the craftsmen with blueprints are dependent on getting this very rare material from only one source.&#x20;

As most of the Chest plates of Lightening Deception are prized possessions of the owners, they are rarely for sale. The University of Doork East at Birkbeck Road have been able to get hold of one specimen and have been trying to reverse engineer the process to see if they can figure out a way to mass produce the armor. So far, progress has been very limited.
