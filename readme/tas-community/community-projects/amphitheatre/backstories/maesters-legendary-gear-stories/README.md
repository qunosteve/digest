# Maester's Legendary Gear Stories

## **Foreword from Grand Maester Esmond Mars**

By telling stories, new revelations will be made. The background of certain items and places can lead to the discovery of new segments and further develop the general narrative. In the Amphitheatre there will be weapons used in combat. Some of these weapons are special, while others are legendary. A few of the weapons will have a story behind them; the story should give the buyer of such a weapon a greater sense of pride and awe when wielding it in battle. Further to this, the weapon story will also give more insight into ape life across society, and we might even learn more about the districts and customs therein.

The Amphitheatre will see 19 different kinds of items. There are 7 different types with subclasses. Throwing, bows, two-handed weapons, one-handed weapons. polearms, shields, and armor. In this collection of legendary weapons lore, you will find one particular lore for 22 individual weapons. These weapons are by no means the only ones that will be available in the Amphitheatre, but they should give you some insight as to what to expect when the game is playable, and the weapons are ready to be crafted. This document will list everything in sequence. Later, a bounty for making an art piece for each of these items will be issued in the discord of the Amphitheatre. After this, each weapon will be separated into its own document and be given a number. This will then be added to the Maester's annals and will forever be listed as Amphitheatre lore.

While these items are highly sought after, their high cost to craft and extremely low chance to produce an item with legendary combat effectiveness are purposely intended for these to be more of a “collector’s” item when crafting. Those seeking items with less expensive combat effectiveness will be better served in using sponsor’s blueprints. Please see the [probabilities](../../sponsorship-structure.md#individual-sponsorship-incentives) in the sponsorship document for reference.

I hope you will enjoy these short stories, and maybe draw some inspiration from them yourself. Many of the districts and weapons portrayed here are intended to be expanded on for further stories, so we hope for great engagement. Also note that you could own your very own weapon lore, and the rights for royalties when crafting it if you [donate the sum of 250K $SOCIETY](../../sponsorship-structure.md#majestic-nobles-sponsorship) to the creation of the Amphitheatre
