# The Butcher of Canmard City

## Carver de' Medici - The Butcher of Canmard City

At first glance, Carver de' Medici is a typical ape from a noble family. He wears his shutter shades and his silver earring almost every day. And even if he had a good taste in fashion, he prefers to wear nothing but his top hat.&#x20;

Although it was a rather unusual passion for an ape of his parentage, Carver became fascinated with all kinds of small weapons at an early age. He acquired knowledge of various themes and techniques. And over the years, was able to acquire a fine collection of traditional antiques, but also some more modern knives and hatchets.&#x20;

Both his father and mother were successful bankers. They ran a well-known family-owned business that was bequeathed to them at a young age. As the firstborn son of his parents, it was incontrovertible that it would have to be Carver who would be responsible for carrying on this legacy and the many years of generational wealth of his family. And so, his path seemed to be predetermined.&#x20;

However, even if the private education he enjoyed at home would have easily enabled him to steer the fortunes of the family business, he realized early on... this is not his path. This is not the path he wanted to take. He wanted to carve out his place in the world, with his own hands. By the sweat of his face. And so, he headed out on a search. A search for the one thing that would please his wandering and restless soul, even if that meant breaking with family traditions.&#x20;

It was on a beautiful Sunday when Carver was wandering around the Canmard City market and his attention was caught by the butcher's stall. He didn't know why at that moment, but he was magnetized by the old butcher's work. He was fascinated by the way he wielded his meat cleaver, so full of strength and yet so skilled and precise. At first, he didn't understand his enthusiasm for this seemingly brutal work, but he saw more in it than the raw cutting and chopping of the meat and flesh.&#x20;

Even weeks later, he could not get the picture of the hard-working butcher out of his head. So, one day he approached the butcher and began a conversation with him. Carver hung on the butcher's lips and absorbed every bit of information and story the old man had to tell about his profession. It quickly became clear that the elderly and childless old man wanted nothing more than a worthy successor to teach him and let him benefit from his experiences. Carver felt a lightning bolt go through his entire body at the same moment he understood this. Was this fate? Was this what he had been looking for all along? The fire in him was definitely awakened!&#x20;

Inspired by that one moment, Carver visited the old butcher more and more often in his little store to watch his work and learn from his experience. And it didn't take long for the old butcher to realize the potential that lurked within Carver de' Medici. When Carver picked up the meat cleaver for the first time and actually wielded it, the butcher was amazed at how much dexterity he showed in handling it and the power that laid behind his swings.&#x20;

In the months that followed, a master-disciple relationship developed that was second to none. The old butcher sharpened Carverâ€™s understanding of anatomical knowledge and helped him perfect his swing with the meat cleaver and taught him all he could with his experience.&#x20;

At the end of their mutual journey, the old butcher made a very special gift for the young Carver de' Medici. Because already in the first days with Carver, it had become very clear to the old butcher where the path would lead them both. And so, at an early stage, he hired one of the best-known master blacksmiths in the entire Ape Society to make a meat cleaver like no other before. It was without question an unusual order for the blacksmith, who usually only forged weapons in the glowing fires of his ovens, but he put all his skill and all of his heart into this masterpiece.

Reverently, Carver received the gift from the old butcher and inspected it carefully. The ergonomic handle was made of beautiful olive wood. The material looked very noble yet was very solid and fit perfectly in his hand. The steel of the blade was of the highest quality and had been forged with a lot of skill, you could see that right away. Throughout the entire blade, Carver did not spot a single impurity, even upon a closer look. He had not seen such sharpness in a meat cleaver before. A true masterpiece!&#x20;

And so, Carver and the old butcher, who had taught him everything he knew, went in different directions. With the knowledge he had acquired and the fire that was burning inside of him, Carver began to go after his dream. Just as he had always imagined. by the sweat of his face and with his own hands.&#x20;

Today, many years later, Carver de' Medici is the owner of a store for exquisite meats, cheeses, and sausages, known beyond the borders of Canmard City. As he had always desired, he achieved this dream by his own efforts and built up his store and reputation from scratch. Nowadays, quite a few of his customers even claim that his meat is the tastiest around. If you are looking to try his exquisite goods, you usually have to order them months in advance.&#x20;

Life was good for Carver, but something was missing. Yet, what was it? Had he lost his fire for the butcher's trade? No. It certainly wasn't that. It felt like. another fire wanted to be lit up. And just like when Carver first met the old butcher, a lightning bolt went through his body again recently when he spotted a very special placard on the news board at City Hall:

> Suspense, sweat, blood and fame ... all this and much more will await you in the Amphitheatre. A place where any ape, regardless of his profession or status, can achieve acknowledgement and wealth in thrilling team battles. Do you think you have the strength and skill to compete with the best? Then you are exactly in the right place!&#x20;
>
> Furthermore, we are still looking for apes who are ready to face the challenge of working on one of the biggest projects of the ape society so far. So, join the construction site and claim your place in history!

And once again, Carver was not able to tell what it was. Was it his deep inner passion for sport? Or did he simply want to compete in a ferocious competition? No matter what it was, he was absolutely sure about one thing... it had to be fate. At the very thought of competing with other brave fighters and convincing the audience in the arena of his abilities, his blood began to boil, and his heart started to beat faster. Finally, he could show everyone that Carver de' Medici had much more up his sleeve.&#x20;

So, he decided to visit the construction site the very next morning. He wanted to see the progress with his own eyes and get to know the team behind this large project. And already after the first day, he was convinced by what he saw and what he felt. He knew: From now on he would support the Amphitheatre with everything he had. And so, he decided out of complete conviction for a generous sponsorship of no less than 50,000 $society from his own private fortune.&#x20;

We will certainly see both advertising for "Carver's exquisite meats, cheeses and charcuterie" in the advertising spaces and Carver de' Medici himself with his meat cleaver, fighting in exciting competitions in the arena of the Amphitheatre. For him, it already feels like he found the last piece of a puzzle that has remained unfinished for years. Carver de Medici feels it with every fiber of his body. Here he is exactly right!
