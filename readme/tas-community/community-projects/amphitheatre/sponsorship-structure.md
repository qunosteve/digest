# Gear, Blueprints & Sponsorship Structure

Sponsorships go to [**$amphitheatre**](https://cexplorer.io/address/addr1q8fwev2r3un65kzcf7e6qn3zwzkkwnhcag7snzljhltvmz8rs790wsvw4fuqga0c8ghfmq0h0l50pmmpwf0qffnlj5vqamvjsl) or [**$tasbounty**](https://cexplorer.io/address/addr1q8fwev2r3un65kzcf7e6qn3zwzkkwnhcag7snzljhltvmz8rs790wsvw4fuqga0c8ghfmq0h0l50pmmpwf0qffnlj5vqamvjsl)

## **Foreword**

To sustain the fervor of the Amphitheatre’s construction, the project needs to attract sufficient funding from donors so builders can be compensated for the operating costs of building and testing the amphitheatre. However, without a proper incentivized structure for the donors, they will not be motivated to contribute. This document details the solution to this sponsorship’s dilemma by providing lore and utility to that sponsor’s ape as appreciation for their gracious donations.

## **Gear and Crafting System**

To grasp the magnitude of the Sponsor’s incentives, we must first define the Amphitheatre’s Gear and Crafting system.

### **Common Gear aka "Base Gear"**

The Amphitheatre’s contenders will need gear to be effective in the arena. Common Gear, aka "Base Gear" is gear that is inspired by the Ape Society Profile Pic traits. Future plans will allow apes with specific weapon or armor traits to inherit that piece of gear in their inventory with the option to equip in their loadout. Common gear will also be available to craft for most gear slots. Common gear will not be associated with any sponsor's blueprints. Common gear will have no bonus to combat effectiveness, this gear is merely intended to give contenders the "bare minimum" to give them a chance in the arena.&#x20;

### **Blueprinted Gear**&#x20;

In Phase 4, we will start to implement the rollout of blueprinted gear. Blueprint designs can ONLY be unlocked by Sponsors and in order for crafters to gain access to a specific design, they will have to indirectly pay royalties to the blueprint owner via the Amphitheatre's crafting mechanism. Blueprinted gear will follow this weapon effectiveness tier model:

* Common (Base) - +0 bonus points towards gear effectiveness
* Honoured - +5 bonus points towards gear effectiveness
* Exalted – +10 bonus points towards gear effectiveness
* Majestic – +15 bonus points towards gear effectiveness
* Supreme – +20 bonus points towards gear effectiveness
* Heroic – +20 bonus points towards gear effectiveness + Additional future perks\


Example Majestic variant of "The Butcher's Oath" blueprinted weapon, which is based on the Majestic Blueprint design unlocked by Carver 'de Medici:

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/carvers_cleaver_anim_rotation_withBackground.gif" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### **Blueprint Crafting (Minting) Mechanics and Usage Costs**

As apes opt to use more advanced blueprints, higher tier blueprints will guarantee them access to higher performance gear; however, higher tier blueprints command a higher royalty fee as well. Basically, higher blueprint cost = higher guaranteed weapon effectiveness. There will always be a chance for ANY blueprint to generate a Supreme or even Heroic tier variant, but using higher tier blueprints increases the likelihood. See [#individual-sponsorship-incentives](sponsorship-structure.md#individual-sponsorship-incentives "mention") for probabilities.\
\
The base crafting cost that all blueprint gear will be derived from is 750 $SOCIETY. This base cost goes back to the Amphitheatre team. Any amount over the base cost of 750 society is given to the blueprint holder as royalties. \
\
There are a few reasons for the "base cost" of 750 SOCIETY:

1. Mitigate Blueprint Sponsor "Duping" - In the context of video games, "Duping" is a term that refers to a practice where players exploit a game's mechanics to create duplicate copies of in-game items, currency, or other valuable resources. These duplicates can then be used or traded, giving the player an unfair advantage or disrupting the game's economy. By redirecting a portion of blueprint usage fees away from the blueprint sponsor, it discourages and mitigates the likelihood of this behavior by that sponsor.\

2. Operating Costs and Stimulus. As we get close to stimulating the Amphitheatre's steady growth and scaling up our infrastructure for community adoption, we'll need to make sure we have adequate funding to cover the operating costs of web, marketing, game server, and potentially storage infrastructure environment. We want to make sure Amphitheatre gets an adequate runway before it's fully sustained by the community.

It's essential to emphasize that these costs are not expected to diminish over time, even as the circulating supply of SOCIETY decreases. This is due to the direct correlation between blueprint royalties and a sponsor's initial contribution to support Amphitheatre construction. Lowering royalty payouts as time progresses could discourage sponsors from contributing. Please consider this aspect when formulating your crafting strategy, especially as you accumulate SOCIETY in preparation for the Amphitheatre.

The only scenario in which blueprint usage costs could decrease is if sponsors are reimbursed in proportion to the reduction in blueprint usage costs. For instance, if a sponsor originally donated 1 million SOCIETY and we subsequently reduce blueprint usage costs by 33.3%, to honor the commitment made to that sponsor at the time of their donation, they would require 333,000 SOCIETY as compensation.



### **Heroic Gear**

Heroic gear is the top tier variant of Blueprinted Gear. Heroic gear will have the same “combat effectiveness” as Supreme gear, **plus** will give future (currently undisclosed) bonuses to the ape wielding that piece of gear.&#x20;



### **Recently Uncovered Legendary Gear Stories**

Upon some recent discoveries, Grand Maester Esmond Mars has deeply researched various excerpts of folklore alluding to blueprints that were once lost. These [stories](backstories/maesters-legendary-gear-stories/) serve as inspiration for prospective sponsors as they usher in their own blueprinted gear. And who knows, maybe one day some of these items might turn up.



### **Mythical Gear and Expeditions**

In addition to the passionate efforts of our community members who are busy crafting items, intriguing reports have surfaced from intrepid Explorers returning from their distant expeditions. These adventurers claim to have witnessed the existence of enigmatic and potentially legendary item sets during their travels.

As the construction of the Amphitheatre advances, Grand Architect Beltran White will collaborate with realms beyond the Ape Society's borders to facilitate Expeditions. These journeys will grant explorers the remarkable opportunity to venture into uncharted lands, in pursuit of these elusive mythical items. For further information, please refer to the [expeditions-cross-project-collabs.md](expeditions-cross-project-collabs.md "mention")section.\


### **Balance**

We do not want the Amphitheatre to turn into a “pay to win” environment. We want contestants with high tier gear to have access to higher damage, armor, precision, and mobility; however, we don’t want to leave contenders without high tier gear with zero chances of winning. During phases 3 and 4, there will be extensive testing done to find the right balance of increased weapon stats and fair play. There will also be efforts to establish opportunities for skilled players to advance even if they find themselves with limited capital but possess a surplus of time and dedication.



### **Secondary Market Trading**

Amphitheatre gear can be traded on the secondary market. We will setup a structure almost identical to the Ape Society Market where only SOCIETY can be used to buy/sell Amphitheatre gear.



## **Sponsorships (How to Unlock your own Blueprint)**

**Destination Wallet Address**

Donations/sponsorships will need to go to the wallet with the [$amphitheatre](https://cexplorer.io/address/addr1q8fwev2r3un65kzcf7e6qn3zwzkkwnhcag7snzljhltvmz8rs790wsvw4fuqga0c8ghfmq0h0l50pmmpwf0qffnlj5vqamvjsl) or [$tasbounty](https://cexplorer.io/address/addr1q8fwev2r3un65kzcf7e6qn3zwzkkwnhcag7snzljhltvmz8rs790wsvw4fuqga0c8ghfmq0h0l50pmmpwf0qffnlj5vqamvjsl) handle. **Please** be wary and prevent sending to any handles with alternate spellings or variations of amphitheatre as that funding cannot be recovered if sent to the wrong address.

### **Gear Slots**

There are 19 gear "slots" that sponsors can sponsor a blueprint for:

* Armour pieces: Head, Shoulders/Cape, Body, Hands, Boots
* Special: Horse Harness, Shields
* One Handed Weapons: Blunt, Axe, Sword, Spear (All 1h weapons can be wielded with a Shield. Some 1h weapons can double as throwing weapons depending on sponsor's tradeoffs when spending their gear bonus points of their weapon in phase4)
* Two Handed weapons: 2h Mace, 2h Axe, 2h Sword, 2h Polearm (glaive/halberd/etc). (2h weapons will hit harder than 1h weapons)
* Ranged: Crossbows, Bolts (for crossbows), Bows, Arrows (for bows),&#x20;

Here's a sample visual of the tracker with the 19 slots as of Epoch 387:

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png>)\


### **Gear Slot Soft and Hard Caps**

Update as of Epoch 387 - With our successful progress in fundraising and our commitment to enhancing the visibility of blueprints for crafters while avoiding over-dilution, we have instituted a new blueprint allocation policy featuring both a "soft cap" and a "hard cap" of 3 and 5 blueprints per slot, respectively.

To clarify, this means that sponsors can support a maximum of three individual sponsorships per slot, with a notable exception: sponsorships unlocked exclusively through [blueprint-token.md](blueprint-token.md "mention") earned by completing Bounties via the [bounty-structure.md](bounty-structure.md "mention") can surpass the soft cap, reaching up to a hard cap of five.

Here are some key points:

1. When you get a blueprint, its tier isn't limited by the item "slot" (more on tiers below).
2. You can upgrade your blueprint to a higher tier if you want to. See [blueprint-token.md](blueprint-token.md "mention") for details.
3. The deadline for upgrades is tentatively set for the end of phase 4, but this can be decided by a vote in the governance channel.

Additionally, it's crucial to debunk a common misconception: the ownership of a specific tier of blueprint in a particular slot does not prevent others from unlocking the same tier within that blueprint slot. Multiple majestic blueprints for a 2h sword, for instance, are entirely permissible.

### **Sponsorship Tiers**

There are 4 tiers of sponsorships. Here are the requirements to unlock them:

* Honoured Merchant's Sponsorship – 10k $SOCIETY or Blueprint Token donation
* Exalted Consult's Sponsorship – 50k $SOCIETY or Blueprint Token donation
* Majestic Noble's Sponsorship – 250k $SOCIETY or Blueprint Token donation
* Supreme Ruler's Sponsorship – 1mil $SOCIETY or Blueprint Token donation

Once a donation is submitted, to authenticate their donation, donors will need to provide these pieces of information to the Amphitheatre team (via the [authenticate-donations-here](https://discord.com/channels/1008361097553776743/1018579830272438292) channel within the Amphitheatre discord):

* Transaction ID of the donation.
* Ape Name
* Type of gear they wish to use to be associated with their donation. List of gear types can be found in the previous section. To clarify, multiple donations per gear slot is allowed.
* (Optional) Twitter handle to tag for the congratulatory announcement tweet.

### **Certificate**

Once authenticated, the Certificate NFT will be minted and sent to the wallet where that ape resides, so make sure the ape not listed on a marketplace or in escrow on a lending platform. The donation doesn’t need to come from that wallet, as the transaction id specifies what and how much was sent to the Amphitheatre wallet.

IMPORTANT: The wallet where this certificate resides will most likely be the wallet that receives the benefits outlined in this document.

## **Individual Sponsorship Incentives**

Sponsorship Certificate holders will unlock both utility AND will be honored by the Maester. The incentives increase as higher tiers of donations are unlocked.

### **Royalties from Crafting (All Sponsor Tiers)** <a href="#sponsors-blueprints" id="sponsors-blueprints"></a>

Craftsmen can choose to craft common gear or personalized gear via the blueprints system. When they craft personalized gear, the $SOCIETY spent during each craft **beyond** the base rate goes to the sponsor of personalized gear as perpetual passive income to the sponsor. There will be 4 tiers of provisions:

### **Honoured Merchant's Sponsorship**

### **Lottery airdrop from Amphitheatre Admissions (Supreme Certificates)**

Everyone who holds a Supreme Certificate has a chance to be airdropped a lump sum of 5% of admissions from each tournament.

## **Family Competition for Class Perks (Ended on May 8, 2023 )**

**Reasoning**

To help reward the most devoted families that support the Amphitheatre, we’re also providing “family perks” based on class for the most passionate supporters. This competition will be led by kings as these family perks (if won) will be in addition to that King’s individual perks.

### **Competition Mechanics**

* This competition ends on the official completion of Phase 3!
* The family who unlocks the highest tier donation in their class by the deadline wins.
* Families must provide the TXIDs, amount of $SOCIETY, desired slot, and Family name of the donations in a message in the official [Family Competition](https://discord.com/channels/1008361097553776743/1036335464195567688) discord channel in the Amphitheatre Discord for authentication and tally of donations.
* A family’s King or approved family member(s) must be involved in case their family’s donation is surpassed by another family of the same class. There will be no refunds if a family is surpassed or if they get beat to the **Supreme** donation, so families must be strategic; however, as a consolation, that family will still retain the “individual perks/incentives” for their sponsorship.
* The **FIRST** family who unlocks the **Supreme Ruler’s Sponsorship** for their class seals the win for their family. The transaction IDs provides a way to prove which donations come in first. In tight races, the families whos’ **Supreme** donations get validated in later blocks don’t win but still unlock their King’s individual perks. If competing families’ **Supreme** donations “tie” or fall **on the same block,** both families win the perk.
* Donation transactions must be explicitly defined as a contribution to a family competition or to a non-competition individual sponsorship. If not explicitly defined, individual is assumed. Donations cannot be "double spent". For example, If 5 family members donate 10k SOCIETY, they either have to choose 1 Exalted sponsorship or 5 Honoured sponsorships, not both.

## **Early Sponsor Appreciation**

There were a few **Early Sponsors** who supported the Amphitheatre before this document was released. This section outlines the perks those early sponsors have secured as appreciation for early faith in the project.

### **The Chiesa Family**

Before the sponsorship incentives were even a thought, **King** **Amilcar** **Chiesa** knew the Amphitheatre would be a huge boon to the Ape Society. King Chiesa was the first king who took a leap of faith in donating. He rallied his family to be the Amphitheatre’s very first donor of **79.62k** SOCIETY! To reward the Chiesa family for the first ever donation to the Amphitheatre, the Chiesa family has locked in a non-competitive perk of a **25%** rebate when renting the Chiesa shops.&#x20;

As the Amphitheatre’s first sponsor, recipients of the Sponsor’s line of certificates will be honoured by the signature of King Amilcar Chiesa.

### **Florimond Brown**

Florimond Brown’s early donation is appreciated, and in consolation for his contribution not being eligible to help his family, Architect white upgrades his early donation of **50k** to a **Majestic Sponsorship.**

### **Carver de’ Medici**

Early on, Carver de’ Medici read the Amphitheatre’s plan and instantly fell in love with the vision! Since Carver de’ Medici was an early donor, Carver has “locked” a non-competitive Noble’s slot (see noble’s individual competition). By unlocking a Majestic blueprint, Carver has currently secured a 50**%** discount for his team for the large scale tournaments outlined in the Original Proposal.

Also, recipients of the Inquisitor’s line of certificates will be honoured by the signature of Carver de’ Medici.

### **The White Family**

Architect Beltran White was approached by his King, Radcliff White (aka the Naked king), to see where he could help with the Amphitheatre. After discussing how the Amphitheatre will entertain all members of the Cardano blockchain, King White has declared that the White family will be the distinguished hosts to welcome all into the Amphitheatre by donating **250k SOCIETY**. Architect Beltran White is overjoyed from the blessing shown by the leader of his family. To celebrate the White family’s early commitment to the Amphitheatre, King White and the White Family gain the following perks:

* King White unlocks a **Majestic Noble’s Sponsorship**.
* As distinguished hosts, the White family gets **50%** discount on Amphitheatre admissions for the Tournaments outlined in the Original Proposal.
* King White earns naming rights to the Amphitheatre
* King White earns the “individual perks” associated with a **Majestic Noble’s Sponsorship** outlined above.

Builders of the Amphitheatre will be recognized not only by the Architect, but by Royalty. Recipients of the Artisan’s line of certificates will be honoured by the signature of King Radcliff White going forward.
