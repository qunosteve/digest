# Construction Plan

## :white\_check\_mark: **Phase 1 - Basic Loadout**&#x20;

Webpage querying a Cardano API or db sync node for an ape’s loadout data and displaying it to the user. We can use existing fungible tokens to serve as placeholders for weapons/armor as a proof of concept.&#x20;

:white\_check\_mark: [Click here](https://amphitheatre.vercel.app/) to access and try out the Amphitheatre Armoury dApp

## :white\_check\_mark: **Phase 2 - In-Game Proof of Concept**&#x20;

This is where we will integrate the blockchain query to feed data to a moddable game (this is where we’ll need c#) so we can use the “loadout” in-game. The game in the proposal is “Mount & Blade, Bannerlord”. In this phase we will also test user authentication to dedicated servers where they can only use apes & equipment they own in their wallets. Similar to how wallets link to discord profiles, how to link our Steam accounts to our wallets. These dedicated servers will serve as the arena.&#x20;

:white\_check\_mark: Implement [Governance Channel](https://discord.com/channels/1008361097553776743/1054205054774681670) for Certificate Holders (Decisions on how the Amphitheatre will progress)

## :point\_right: **Phase 3 - Arena Polishing**&#x20;

With the proof of concepts behind us, we can now commence in heavy modding, custom artwork, & ape 3d modeling/skins phase. Minting actual Amphitheatre native tokens that represent armor and weapons in-game etc. visuals, loading screens with lore, artwork, level design, etc. Basically immersing the participants in a world of “The Ape Society”. Amphitheatre should be ready to use and show off to the public after this phase. \

## **Phase 4 - Community Scaling**

Start tying Class utility (as per proposal) to the game. Craftsmen can craft (probably with $SOCIETY at this point), Explorers can breed horses, Artists Can mint Sigils, etc. This is where we might need to start pulling in smart contract utility for automated match payouts, etc. Also tie in the other roles into the Amphitheature such as announcers, administrators, arbiters, staking managers etc as per proposal. This is where community participation starts to scale. Integrate streaming/chatrooms, etc. More plutus contracts to facilitate staking, tournament distributions, collecting admissions, etc. Will explore the feasibility of integrating with oracles such as Charli3 and Chainlink to automate some of the tournament payouts and feed outcomes to class utilities. Will also explore the current Cardano ecosystem to see if there are any avaiable metaverses to build an Amphitheatre plot on.

Phase 2 Update: This is where we will implement the [Sponsor's Blueprints](sponsorship-structure.md)

## **Phase 5 - Collaborations and Beyond**
