# Amphitheatre

The Amphitheatre is a virtual destination where members of The Ape Society can compete in arena tournaments for $SOCIETY, bragging rights, and glory. Not only do arena contenders have a chance to earn $SOCIETY, but members of every class have a role in the Amphitheatre to bring it to life. For fulfilling these roles, they are compensated a percentage of admission fees in $SOCIETY collected at each tournament.

Open to all of Cardano, the Amphitheatre is a Web3 destination where all are welcome to congregate, enjoy music & entertainment, stake predictions on the outcomes of the tournaments, buy/sell goods, and network with their fellow Cardano community members.

Community members who help build the Amphitheatre are issued Certificates that represent the skills they provide while building the project. In the future, as our world becomes more aware of the power of NFTs to issue official documents like Titles, Contracts, etc.; these certificate NFTs will represent an non-refutable "resume" where contributors can show future employers in web3
