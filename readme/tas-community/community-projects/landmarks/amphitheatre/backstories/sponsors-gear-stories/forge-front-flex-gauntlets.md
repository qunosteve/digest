# Forge Front Flex Gauntlets

A Smith in his forge is all too aware of the need to protect his hands. While the fire and hammer get the attention of a client it is the mitt that protects, shields, and locks in the tong or hammer to the hand. For a good mitt, a Smith must consider the variables of dexterity, weight, strength, and grip. Something similar could be said for the soldier and his gear. While the attention and glory are more often than not given to the sword, the Smith knows the sword is simply an extension of the gauntlet. For it is the gauntlet that gives protection to the hand and also allows the combatant to wield the sword with a torque and force that makes the gauntlet, sword and arm seem as one.

It was to this end that Bradley Smith was charged to lead a team from the Forge Front to create a perfect gauntlet for combat. Bradley had the means and imagination to lead such an endeavor. About a decade ago, Bradley Smith had made a name for himself when he invented large cylinder drums whereby, he was able to push the steel between the drums. This produced a sheet of steel that was uniform and provided a width controlled by the distance between the two drums. Bradley Drums Inc. was born and the very laborious task of hammering out steel into sheets began to disappear.

Bradley began the Smith Forge Front task by dividing the team into two groups. The first group, led by himself, needed to determine the width of the steel with a realistic weight for combat. After a series of tests, it was clear that a 16-gauge thickness was optimal for both strength and weight.

Meanwhile, Hilton Smith was put in charge of the second group. Hilton needed to work out the mechanics of the dexterity of the gauntlet. The first thing that needed to be considered was the type of leather glove under the gauntlet. Hilton suggested sheep’s leather as the under-garment mitt. Sheep’s skin was more durable and pliable and allowed for the dexterity needed to fight in combat. As a bonus, it absorbed sweat and kept the hand and outer layer of the mitt dry. Next, Hilton’s team needed to decide on whether to use a one-piece glove design or 20–30-piece metal scales design. Each design had its strengths and weaknesses. While the glove design aided the soldier to swing the sword with more torque force, the scales provided the agility needed. Hilton came up with the idea of creating a pin across the palm area that combined these strengths. The pin locked the sword within the gauntlet to secure it while the scales left the fingers in a flexible position for moveability.

Once it was decided that the gauntlets use the scales design, Bradley rolled out the sheets while others drew the patterns that needed to be cut, then indented the steel scales using a ball to shape the steel to form to a finger, and finally polished it to a brilliant finish. Some of the scales and parts were forged to each other while other parts were riveted and tied with leather strips. Every decision Hilton and his team made kept in mind the soldiers need to have flexibility in some areas while keeping the rigidity to help bring the strength needed. Bradley was only too pleased to present the finished product to the King’s Regent, Tye Smith. Tye thought the design was perfect. Through teamwork and ingenuity, they solved the trilemma of the gauntlets. The perfect balance of protection, strength and flexibility had been found. Tye put the gauntlets on and inspected the dozens of unique pieces forged, strapped, and pinned together -just like the Forge Front!
