# Sponsorship Structure

Sponsorships go to [**$amphitheatre**](https://cexplorer.io/address/addr1q8fwev2r3un65kzcf7e6qn3zwzkkwnhcag7snzljhltvmz8rs790wsvw4fuqga0c8ghfmq0h0l50pmmpwf0qffnlj5vqamvjsl) or [**$tasbounty**](https://cexplorer.io/address/addr1q8fwev2r3un65kzcf7e6qn3zwzkkwnhcag7snzljhltvmz8rs790wsvw4fuqga0c8ghfmq0h0l50pmmpwf0qffnlj5vqamvjsl)

## **Foreword**

To sustain the fervor of the Amphitheatre’s construction, the project needs to attract sufficient funding from donors so builders can be compensated for the operating costs of building and testing the amphitheatre. However, without a proper incentivized structure for the donors, they will not be motivated to contribute. This document details the solution to this sponsorship’s dilemma by providing lore and utility to that sponsor’s ape as appreciation for their gracious donations.

## **Stewardship of the Amphitheatre**

Stewards of the Amphitheatre (currently the Architect and the Maester, with future plans to appoint an Artisan, Maestro, and Inquisitor), who are authorized to issue certificates and bounty payouts from the Amphitheatre wallet, are merely charged with supervising the Amphitheatre’s assets and do not consider the assets their own. The stewardship’s mission is to act in the spirit and for the betterment of the Ape Society Community. Every transaction the stewardship makes (both incoming sponsorships and outgoing bounty payouts) will be logged in a transparent way for the community to audit as they wish. Stewards of the Amphitheatre are not authorized to spend the $SOCIETY earned for anything other than Bounties. If there are any outside purchases that need to be made to support the Amphitheatre (such as hosting hosts, metaverse plots, music licensing, etc), the Stewardship will submit proposals for the Ape Society DAO to vote on, and will use Amphitheatre funds when possible. Even though this is an independently funded project, the stewardship grants the TAS DAO authorization take action in protecting Apes by calling a vote to recover funds from the Amphitheatre wallet if the stewardship is deemed no longer fit to lead the project.

**\*Roadmap Adjustment**

In the rough “roadmap” of the Amphitheatre’s construction, posted in discord, phase 6 is considered the “Ape Enrichment” phase. The purpose of the Ape enrichment phase will allow for individual apes to “personalize” gear to their liking to be crafted and used in the Amphitheatre. This document details how the “Ape Enrichment” mechanics will be driven by the sponsorship structure as incentives and will most likely be prioritized sooner in the roadmap (around phase 4).

## **Gear and Crafting System**

To grasp the magnitude of the Sponsor’s incentives, we must first define the Amphitheatre’s Gear and Crafting system.

### **Crafting & Base Cost**

The Amphitheatre’s contestants will need gear to be effective in the arena. Gear will be crafted by craftsmen. The base crafting cost that all blueprinted crafting is derived from is is 750 $SOCIETY. This crafting cost increases as apes opt to use more advanced blueprints as they have to pay royalties to the blueprint owners (sponsors). It is important to note that these costs **will** **not** by default decrease over time as the supply of SOCIETY decreases, as blueprint royalty income is directly linked to a sponsor’s static monetary donation to fund the construction of the Amphitheatre. Decreasing their royalty payouts over time will de-incentivize sponsors from contributing. Keep this in mind when devising your crafting strategy going forward as you stockpile SOCIETY in preparation for the Amphitheatre.

### **Common Gear**

Common gear will be the very inexpensive to craft. Common gear will be available to craft for every gear slot and will not be associated with any donor’s blueprints. Common gear will have 25% combat effectiveness and common gear is currently planned to be a consumable (token burned after use) in the Amphitheatre.

### **Personalized Blueprinted Gear**

As we find a balance for the gear stats, we will start to implement the buildout of sponsor-backed blueprint-driven craftable gear in Phase 4. These blueprint designs can ONLY be unlocked by Sponsors and will cost $SOCIETY to craft. All Blueprints will have a chance of crafting “higher tier” variants of that desired gear style with higher combat effectiveness. Gear crafted with this system is persistent and these tokens will not be burned when equipped in the Amphitheatre. Blueprinted gear will follow this weapon effectiveness tier model:

* Honoured Gear - 25% weapon effectiveness
* Exalted Gear – 50% weapon effectiveness
* Majestic Gear – 75% weapon effectiveness
* Supreme Gear – 100% weapon effectiveness
* Heroic Gear – 100% weapon effectiveness + Ape perk

### **Heroic Gear**

Heroic gear will have the same “combat effectiveness” as Supreme gear, **plus** will give bonuses to the ape wo wields that item (think running spead, health, etc). All sponsor’s blueprints **will** have a chance to craft a heroic version of that item (outlined later in this document). Due to its extremely rare chance to craft, the pursuit to make a heroic item can prove to be a monumentally expensive task and will be an extremely rare sight to behold in the arena.

### **Recently Uncovered Legendary Gear Stories**

Upon some recent discoveries, Grand Maester Esmond Mars has deeply researched various excerpts of folklore alluding to gear that was once lost. These [stories](backstories/maesters-legendary-gear-stories/) serve as inspiration for prospective sponsors as they usher in their own blueprinted gear. And who knows, maybe one day some of these items might turn up.

### **Mythical Gear and Expeditions**

Aside from the expensive crusade of crafting a legendary item, there are whispers of Explorers returning from distant expeditions who have reported sightings of potential mythical item sets in their travels. As the construction of the Amphitheatre progresses, Grand Architect Beltran White will coordinate with other realms outside of the Ape Society to sponsor Expeditions for explorers to travel to these lands for a chance to find these mythical items. See [Expeditions ](expeditions-cross-project-collabs.md)for more detail.&#x20;

### **Balance**

We do not want the Amphitheatre to turn into a “pay to win” environment. We want contestants with high tier gear to have access to higher damage, armor, precision, and mobility; however, don’t want to leave contestants without the high tier gear with zero chances of winning. During phases 3 and 4, there will be extensive testing done to find the right balance of increased weapon stats and fair play. There will also be efforts to establish opportunities for skilled players to "work their way up" if they're low on capital.

## **Sponsorship Tiers**

**Destination Wallet Address**

Donations/sponsorships will need to go to the wallet with the [$amphitheatre](https://cexplorer.io/address/addr1q8fwev2r3un65kzcf7e6qn3zwzkkwnhcag7snzljhltvmz8rs790wsvw4fuqga0c8ghfmq0h0l50pmmpwf0qffnlj5vqamvjsl) or [$tasbounty](https://cexplorer.io/address/addr1q8fwev2r3un65kzcf7e6qn3zwzkkwnhcag7snzljhltvmz8rs790wsvw4fuqga0c8ghfmq0h0l50pmmpwf0qffnlj5vqamvjsl) handle. **Please** be wary and prevent sending to any handles with alternate spellings or variations of amphitheatre as that funding cannot be recovered if sent to the wrong address.

### **Gear Slots**

There are 19 gear "slots" that sponsors can sponsor a blueprint for:

* Armour pieces: Head, Shoulders/Cape, Body, Hands, Boots
* Special: Horse Harness, Shields
* One Handed Weapons: Blunt, Axe, Sword, Spear (All 1h weapons can be wielded with a Shield. Some 1h weapons can double as throwing weapons depending on sponsor's tradeoffs when designing the utilities of their weapon in phase4)
* Two Handed weapons: 2h Mace, 2h Axe, 2h Sword, 2h Polearm (glaive/halberd/etc). (2h weapons will hit harder than 1h weapons)
* Ranged: Crossbows, Bolts (for crossbows), Bows, Arrows (for bows),&#x20;

Here's a sample visual of the tracker with the 19 slots as of Epoch 387:

![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png>)\


### **Gear Slot Soft and Hard Caps (As of Epoch 387)**

Now that we are making good ground on fundraising, and also to to reduce the dilution of blueprints available to the crafter (gives the sponsor's opportunities for their blueprint to be noticed), there is now a "soft cap" of 3 and a **hard cap** of 5 blueprints per slot.  What this means is sponsors can sponsor a max of 3 individual sponsorships per slot. There is only one exemptions for this soft cap: Sponsorships sponsorships unlocked via **only** [blueprint token ](blueprint-token.md)earned by completing [bounties](bounty-structure.md) can exceed the soft cap of 3 of up a hard cap of 5.

Some clarifications: if you have secured a blueprint before the soft cap of an item slot is reached, it can be any tier (tiers discussed below). You can always upgrade the blueprint to a higher tier. (deadline to upgrade is looking like end of phase 3, will put this up for vote in the governance channel). Also, to clear up one misconception out there: Just because someone owns certain tier of blueprint in a specific slot, doesn't mean someone else can't unlock that same tier within that blueprint slot (it is allowed have multiple majestic blueprints for a 2h sword, for example).

### **Sponsorship Tiers**

There are 4 tiers of sponsorships. Here are the requirements to unlock them:

* Honoured Merchant's Sponsorship – 10k $SOCIETY donation
* Exalted Consult's Sponsorship – 50k $SOCIETY donation
* Majestic Noble's Sponsorship – 250k $SOCIETY donation
* Supreme Ruler's Sponsorship – 1mil $SOCIETY donation

Once a donation is submitted, to authenticate their donation, donors will need to provide these pieces of information to the Amphitheatre team (via the [authenticate-donations-here](https://discord.com/channels/1008361097553776743/1018579830272438292) channel within the Amphitheatre discord):

* Transaction ID of the donation.
* Ape Name
* Type of gear they wish to use to be associated with their donation. List of gear types can be found in the previous section. To clarify, multiple donations per gear slot is allowed.
* (Optional) Twitter handle to tag for the congratulatory announcement tweet.

### **Certificate**

Once authenticated, the Certificate NFT will be minted and sent to the wallet where that ape resides, so make sure the ape not listed on a marketplace or in escrow on a lending platform. The donation doesn’t need to come from that wallet, as the transaction id specifies what and how much was sent to the Amphitheatre wallet.

IMPORTANT: The wallet where this certificate resides will most likely be the wallet that receives the benefits outlined in this document.

## **Individual Sponsorship Incentives**

Sponsorship Certificate holders will unlock both utility AND will be honored by the Maester. The incentives increase as higher tiers of donations are unlocked.

### **Royalties from Crafting (All Sponsor Tiers)** <a href="#sponsors-blueprints" id="sponsors-blueprints"></a>

Craftsmen can choose to craft common gear or personalized gear via the blueprints system. When they craft personalized gear, the $SOCIETY spent during each craft **beyond** the base rate goes to the sponsor of personalized gear as perpetual passive income to the sponsor. There will be 4 tiers of provisions:

### **Honoured Merchant's Sponsorship**

### **Perpetual Staking Rewards from Amphitheatre Admissions (Majestic and Supreme Certificates)**

Everyone who holds a Majestic or Supreme Certificate shares 5% of admissions in the Amphitheatre in perpetuity. We will work out a mechanism as we get closer to implementation. Maybe we can collaborate with AF1 on this to integrate this to the frames‘ staking mechanics.

### **Lottery airdrop from Amphitheatre Admissions (Supreme Certificates)**

Everyone who holds a Supreme Certificate has a chance to be airdropped a lump sum of 5% of admissions from each tournament.

## **Family Competition for Class Perks (Ended on May 8, 2023 )**

**Reasoning**

To help reward the most devoted families that support the Amphitheatre, we’re also providing “family perks” based on class for the most passionate supporters. This competition will be led by kings as these family perks (if won) will be in addition to that King’s individual perks.

### **Competition Mechanics**

* This competition ends on the official completion of Phase 3!
* The family who unlocks the highest tier donation in their class by the deadline wins.
* Families must provide the TXIDs, amount of $SOCIETY, desired slot, and Family name of the donations in a message in the official [Family Competition](https://discord.com/channels/1008361097553776743/1036335464195567688) discord channel in the Amphitheatre Discord for authentication and tally of donations.
* A family’s King or approved family member(s) must be involved in case their family’s donation is surpassed by another family of the same class. There will be no refunds if a family is surpassed or if they get beat to the **Supreme** donation, so families must be strategic; however, as a consolation, that family will still retain the “individual perks/incentives” for their sponsorship.
* The **FIRST** family who unlocks the **Supreme Ruler’s Sponsorship** for their class seals the win for their family. The transaction IDs provides a way to prove which donations come in first. In tight races, the families whos’ **Supreme** donations get validated in later blocks don’t win but still unlock their King’s individual perks. If competing families’ **Supreme** donations “tie” or fall **on the same block,** both families win the perk.
* Donation transactions must be explicitly defined as a contribution to a family competition or to a non-competition individual sponsorship. If not explicitly defined, individual is assumed. Donations cannot be "double spent". For example, If 5 family members donate 10k SOCIETY, they either have to choose 1 Exalted sponsorship or 5 Honoured sponsorships, not both.

## **Early Sponsor Appreciation**

There were a few **Early Sponsors** who supported the Amphitheatre before this document was released. This section outlines the perks those early sponsors have secured as appreciation for early faith in the project.

### **The Chiesa Family**

Before the sponsorship incentives were even a thought, **King** **Amilcar** **Chiesa** knew the Amphitheatre would be a huge boon to the Ape Society. King Chiesa was the first king who took a leap of faith in donating. He rallied his family to be the Amphitheatre’s very first donor of **79.62k** SOCIETY! To reward the Chiesa family for the first ever donation to the Amphitheatre, the Chiesa family has locked in a non-competitive perk of a **25%** rebate when renting the Chiesa shops. Chiesa family is free to unlock higher tier donations if they wish to upgrade to **Majestic** for a **50%** rebate or **Supreme** for a **75%** rebate. Individual perks apply to King Chiesa as well.

As the Amphitheatre’s first sponsor, recipients of the Sponsor’s line of certificates will be honoured by the signature of King Amilcar Chiesa.

### **Florimond Brown**

Florimond Brown’s early donation is appreciated, and in consolation for his contribution not being eligible to help his family, Architect white upgrades his early donation of **50k** to a **Majestic Sponsorship.**

### **Carver de’ Medici**

Early on, Carver de’ Medici read the Amphitheatre’s plan and instantly fell in love with the vision! Since Carver de’ Medici was an early donor, Carver has “locked” a non-competitive Noble’s slot (see noble’s individual competition). Carver has currently secured a **25%** discount for his team. Carver is free to upgrade his sponsorship to unlock greater discounts for his team if he chooses. Only Carver is eligible for **50%** and **75%** team discount if he chooses to unlock the **Majestic** and **Supreme** levels, respectively.

Also, recipients of the Inquisitor’s line of certificates will be honoured by the signature of Carver de’ Medici.

### **The White Family**

Architect Beltran White was approached by his King, Radcliff White (aka the Naked king), to see where he could help with the Amphitheatre. After discussing how the Amphitheatre will entertain all members of the Cardano blockchain, King White has declared that the White family will be the distinguished hosts to welcome all into the Amphitheatre by donating **250k SOCIETY**. Architect Beltran White is overjoyed from the blessing shown by his King. To celebrate the White family’s early commitment to the Amphitheatre, King White and the White Family gain the following perks:

* King White unlocks a **Majestic Noble’s Sponsorship**.
* As distinguished hosts, the White family gets **50%** discount on Amphitheatre admissions (both in the arena and in the audience)
* King White earns naming rights to the Amphitheatre
* King White earns the “individual perks” associated with a **Majestic Noble’s Sponsorship** outlined above

King White can choose to rally his family for more donations in order to unlock a **Supreme** sponsorship any time before Phase 4 if he desires to unlock a **75%** discount for his family and the **Supreme** individual perks.

Builders of the Amphitheatre will be recognized not only by the Architect, but by Royalty. Recipients of the Artisan’s line of certificates will be honoured by the signature of King Radcliff White going forward.

## **Revision History**

Revision 1 - Clarified No Cap on desired gear slot on sponsorships as per convo.

Revision 2 - Cleaned up a typo and added the revision number to the cover page

Revision 3 - Acquired licensing of the Arena Graphic for commercial use

Revision 4 - Reworded a few elements of the Foreword for consisency with the upcoming Bounty structure document. Converted handle text to a hyperlink to the addr to help lower the risk of sending to a wrong address

Revision 5 – Opened up the family competition up to merchant families while retaining the Chiesa perks. Adjusted the Noble team’s donation perks to incentivize higher donations. Mirrored the base cost of crafting gear to lvl 0 frames

Revision 6 – Clarified weapon tier combat effectiveness metrics, included info about recently discovered legendary blueprints, integrated “legendary” item crafting probabilities, clarified crafting costs, and added a 2nd craftsman family competition opportunity. Anticipated a rush of competitors with the Epoch 364 constraint, but as it turns out, we have a slower pace of donations, so that constraint was removed for the competition.
