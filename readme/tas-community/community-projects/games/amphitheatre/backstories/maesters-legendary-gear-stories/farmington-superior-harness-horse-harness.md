# Farmington Superior Harness (Horse harness)

The rolling green hills of Buroont is the perfect place to keep horses. The area sees many lovely estates where the prime focus is to train animals for purposes such as racing, or even combat. Many apes in the area have specialized in taming and caring for the horses their whole lifetime, and as such have accumulated enormous amounts of knowledge of the beasts.

To keep the horse under control it is important to have the right tooling. Explorers and craftsmen in Farmington Avenue have experimented with harnesses specifically used in combat for more than 20 years. By simulating war scenarios with their horses in the local neighborhood, they have perfected equipment to a level that no other craftsmen in the entire society can duplicate.

The secret to this excellent harness is the quality of the leatherwork. The tanning process is done according to secret processes and yields a superior strength to the material. Apart from this, the straps are adjustable so not to cause the horse any discomfort when worn. This makes the process of control very simple on the battlefield and could easily be the difference between life and death.

The blueprints for the Farmington Superior Harness are only kept by the Buroont apes, so the price is rather high as craftsmen cannot keep up with demand.
