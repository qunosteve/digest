# Ventucci Rapid Fire Crossbow

Dempster Ventucci was not born into royalty. He was born into poverty, the son of a farmer. With dreams stuffed full of desire and pockets filled with want, Dempster, like most peasant farmers, had to make the best with what little he had. For the selfless act of helping a Military Officer repair his carriage one hot summer afternoon, the Military Officer gifted Dempster his personal Crossbow as an act of gratitude for Dempsterâ€™s help. While a peasant farmer has little use for such a weapon, Dempster could not take his eyes off of it. The thought, consideration and genius that went into its design was not lost on Dempster who was ever curious and always learning how things worked. After many weeks of studying the mechanical details, Dempster disassembled the crossbow into its base elements and through good ol' fashion ingenuity rebuilt the crossbow to permit a much faster cyclic rate than its original design. After some time had passed, the Military Officer who gifted the original crossbow to Dempster found himself once again passing by his farm. Through idle conversation he inquired as to the whereabouts of the crossbow. Dempster ran to his Cottage to retrieve the redesigned gift and proudly demonstrated the improvements to the Military Officer. The Military Officer was aghast by what he witnessed. This design was so effective and created such a big advantage to the battlefield soldier that the redesigned crossbow became known as the Ventucci RF Crossbow. This single exchange of generosity between Dempster and the Military Officer propelled Dempster Ventucci to the throne as King of the Ventucci Family of Apes.
