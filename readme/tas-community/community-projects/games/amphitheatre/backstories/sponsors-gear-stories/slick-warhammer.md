# Slick (Warhammer)

## **King Radcliff White, King of the People, Fighting For What is Right, But Facing a Huge Conundrum**

**Radcliffe White, the King, and leader of the White family chose as his very first weapon of choice the  ‘Warhammer’. When asked why he chose this weapon he said, “Seemed fitting for a Craftsmen King  to have a weapon that seems rugged and powerful”**  \
\
**The Warhammer as a weapon is not only rugged and powerful as the King anticipated but a weapon  designed to strike with maximum impact, delivering significant blows to body armor. Interestingly it  is referred to as an elaborately decorated and handsome weapon, consisting of a handle and a head made of wood, lead and iron. And so, the Warhammer came to be known as ‘Slick’ the Warhammer.**  \
\
**King White is fondly known as the King of the Apes, humbly serving his community of hardworking  Craftsmen, always striving to fight for what is right. This led to the interesting question of ‘what is  right’ may also be wrong? Is the right thing to do, the right way to reign? Conflicting indeed and  something that got King White scratching his head (literally)! You see making decisions and leading  by way of example may be a right bestowed upon a King, but for King White he needed to  understand what that meant to him and his community of Craftsmen.** \
\
**This deep inspection all came to pass the day he had to make that choice of weaponry. Exactly why  did he choose that Warhammer. Was it all about the power? What exactly does power mean? As a  King is he required to be powerful and is power what holds a community together? You see King  White had to question this as surely a good King should?**  \
\
**It was during this time that the King sought counsel from his Master of Whisperers, who served as  the Kings spymaster and who had a network of informants across all 35 of the kingdoms. His Master  of Whisperers was not chosen lightly you see, this job was of paramount importance to the White  kingdom. So important that his appointment as well as his identity was kept top secret and only  known to the Kings small council. The King instructed his Master of Whisperers to embark upon a  journey across the kingdoms and to seek answers from his wide range of spies. The King needed an  answer to this conundrum that had befallen him. Surely somewhere, some Ape should have the  knowledge and wisdom he said!** \
\
**So immediately on that night the Master of Whisperers set upon his journey to find the answer/s  his King so desperately sought. He travelled for many days and many nights from North to South to  West to East across the kingdoms. The last leg of his travels brought him to the far East to a place  called Doork East. It was here that he heard of a very wise Professor at the Birkbeck University of  Doork East. His most trusted spy arranged for a meeting in a top-secret location with Professor  Monet, but he was told that he could only ask one question!**  \
\
**The Master of Whisperers panicked at the thought of getting the question wrong! He had one  chance to please his King, one chance to free his King of this hounding conundrum! Would he frame  the question in a manner to be understood, and would the answer to the question satisfy the  question? This remains a secret to this day**\
