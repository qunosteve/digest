# Mesmin Ventucci Sponsorship by conviction

Despite his fine family name, Mesmin Ventucci did not have an easy time since life as a trader and the trading business as such were tough. Nobody in this business gives you anything for free. But regardless of all the adversities and hurdles he had to face, he had sworn to always focus on qualities such as integrity, honor, and decency in his dealings. And it was those qualities, coupled with his strong business instincts, that made him so successful and well liked, and secured his position in the world of merchandising.

&#x20;It was a sunny and bright day as Mesmin did his daily walk across the marketplace when he first heard about this particular project. Two other merchants were talking about it at the sword and blade stand. And even though he couldn't understand much of what they were saying, he could tell by their facial expressions and gestures that it had to be something big. Something that could cause a buzz in the Ape Society at some point in the near future.

&#x20;One thing he understood clearly was the name of the project ... They called it "The Amphitheatre." What exactly the Amphitheatre was all about remained unclear to him until that point, but his curiosity was piqued. And so, he began to gather information on the market in order to be able to get an accurate picture of this undertaking.

&#x20;After talking to some merchants, craftsmen and artists at the market, the feeling Mesmin Ventucci had when he heard the two Apes talking about the Amphitheatre was quickly confirmed. After an Ape friend of his revealed where he would find the founders, he visited the construction site to see with his own eyes what he had been hearing.

&#x20;The construction site was a bustle of activity. People were building, writing, programming, discussing, and scheduling. Everyone seemed to be conscientiously doing their job, and yet everyone seemed to be taking time to help each other out. Apes who joined forces because of their convictions were no strangers to Mesmin Ventucci. But what he observed at the Amphitheatre construction site that day, he would later describe as " quite exceptional."

&#x20;Right in the middle of the hustle and bustle, the founder apes centered around Beltran White. When he spotted those apes, the talkative trader in him didn't hesitate for a second and immediately engaged them into a conversation. He was curious to know what exactly it was he could sense on this construction site. What made this project so special? How did they come up with the idea of the Amphitheatre and in which direction will the path they took with such zeal lead them? Grateful for the sincere interest in their work, they answered each and every one of his questions.

&#x20;The moment he realized the full dimensions of this project, he knew immediately.... He wanted to help! He wanted to contribute to the idea... the vision... the dream of the founders of the amphitheater, to become a reality. And he already knew how he could contribute his part to it.&#x20;

Since Mesmin Ventucci always had understood the concept of money well, he was in the privileged position of being able to call a respectable reserve fund his own. Full of confidence in the builders of the Amphitheatre and impressed by the passion and commitment with which the rest of the team were working on the project, he did not hesitate to donate a remarkable amount of money, resulting in a donation of 50,000 $Society, which he gladly put at the disposal of the Amphitheatre.

&#x20;He felt proud to be one of the sponsors of the project and to contribute his part towards the realization of this dream. And it was not a possible profit in the future, that was the main focus of Mesmin. He was concentrating on what really mattered: the importance of the Amphitheatre for the district.... No. for the entire Ape Society and its community.

&#x20;We, the Amphitheatre team, would like to take this opportunity to thank Mesmin Ventucci for this generous donation of 50,000 $Society. We look forward to working with him as a sponsor to make the Amphitheatre's vision a reality.
