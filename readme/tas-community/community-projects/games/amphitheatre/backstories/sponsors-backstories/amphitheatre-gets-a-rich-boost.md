# Amphitheatre Gets a Rich Boost

## Amphitheatre Gets a Rich Boost

[Brotaw District](../../../../../cabins-by-the-ape-society/districts/district-5-brotaw-br.md) - The Ventucci merchants have arrived from their trek to the mountains to procure the stone and materials needed for construction of the new Amphitheatre landmark being built in the city. The scarlet and silver colors of the wagons and horses make quite a spectacle as they take up the whole road. A long procession of horses and wagons make their way down Main Street as they cross through the District 5 gateway into the capital city. Many have come out to greet them as they stand outside their homes and businesses.&#x20;

News of the construction of an Amphitheatre has redoubled the fame of the Ape Society and the capital city in recent weeks. Shrewdnesses from all over Ouroboros are visiting the construction site and keeping the Ape Society flush with tourism. The surge of popularity that passed the artist-family expansion has continued to spill into the culture. In every district, you see workshops and studios popping up. Master artists, with their apprentices and assistants, have the marketplaces buzzing with their creations. Street performers are no longer jeered and neglected. Instead, the skilled and entertaining are celebrated. The addition of the class reshapes artists' lives, and now the aesthetics and acoustics of the city will be transformed in return!&#x20;

Outside the Rich Royal Workshop, Claude Lavigne stands outside the front doors. He is apprentice to Bradford “tocco d’oro” Rich, a nickname the merchants have given him that means “golden touch” in the Great Tongue. Claude is keeping watch for the Ventucci while Bradford and the other apprentice, Pierre, finish preparing the donation chest to be delivered to the Maester of the Amphitheatre. Inside the massive art workshop is a small battalion of apes who are swirling about as one unit, cranking out their duties. Some apes are sculpting molds from wax, others are preparing and packing materials, and in the back, you can hear a master goldsmith finishing up with a lesson on casting. They will most definitely need to train more apes if they are going to keep up with demand.&#x20;

In the middle of the storm is Bradford studying his apprentice’s work on a wax sculpture with a critical eye. Behind him on the mantlepiece, the workshop’s signature ‘Cardano Shield’ hangs as a reminder of quality and excellence. The piece he is looking at is of a graceful gazelle in mid-sprint. It is striking how realistic it looks from afar, but upon closer inspection, the details and texture bring the creature life. However, as usual, the king is the workshop's most hardcore critic.&#x20;

“Art is never finished, Pierre, only abandoned.”&#x20;

Pierre is loading a large wooden chest with $SOCIETY coins for the King’s donation from a large safe in the corner. Without looking up, he tossed in the last coins and rang a small silver bell to call for assistance. A moment later, two helpful apes came over to oblige and drag the heavy box out front to be loaded onto a wagon.&#x20;

“You know a wise ape once told me, ‘Do not be afraid of perfection; you’ll never reach it.’”&#x20;

A smile forms on the King’s face. “Ah yes, the contradictory nature of the artist. I suppose I did say that too.” Bradford stares at the piece for a moment more, grabbing absent-mindedly at the Crown on the stool beside him, thoughts clearly still on his obsessive need to improve his work. The noise of the street can be heard outside as the Ventucci and city officials arrive on the scene.&#x20;

Growing up, Bradford learned artistic acumen from his father, the late Duke Bromley, who was the original court painter for the De ’Medici nobles. As is tradition for the heir of the Rich ancestral seat in the mountain borough of Rue Perdue, Bradford also knew how to handle precious metals and ancient casting techniques from Daedelus Class Master craftsman.&#x20;

The young marquess of Bromley learned quickly. He could soon produce amazing life-like images in his work. Most famous is his work on the various bronze doors of the De’Medici Bank and other important buildings in the kingdom. At a young age, Bradford shared his father’s knack for art and pursued the life of a goldsmith and jeweler making fancy things. When the Ape Society absorbed his family and made him king, Rich made the executive decision to go in full throttle with the growing art trends. Classic Rich family foresight and wise council of the De’ Medici steered King Rich’s family towards investing in sculptors and goldsmiths with a natural affinity for working with precious metals, eventually successfully converting over to the trendy new artist class from a predominantly goldsmithing tribe. Ties to the Davies family miners and the Ventucci Dragon Knights allowed the Rich house to maintain their lucrative mining operation. Rue Perdue’s mines and quarries keep the Rich family workshops here in the capital stocked with the finest inventory.&#x20;

“They are ready for you, your majesty.”&#x20;

The apprentice, Louis, appeared through the door fiddling with a pair of white shutter shades in his hands. Bradford snaps out of his thoughts and fits his crown onto his furry head. As he and Pierre walk to the threshold, Louis hands him the shades and pulls a pair of his own out of his coat pocket. Pierre too knows that it’s “show time” as a third pair makes an appearance. With knowing smirks, the three apes donned their shutter shades in unison and made for the exit.&#x20;

Out in front of the building the Ventucci arrived and began loading the donation chest onto the wagon headed to the Bank House. To entertain the growing crowd, a Hill family bard has begun to sing ballads. Soon Bradford and his apprentices emerge from the workshop to the applause of the onlookers. The gold crown always draws a crowd. He shakes hands with the city officials and Maester of the Amphitheatre who came to collect the donation personally. A personal hero of his, Addison Cortes, mayor of Fraggod East, is also there. A famous conquistador famous for his feats during the civil wars. He reaches out and shakes Bradford's hand and thanks him for his contribution. The artist king’s assistants announce the donation to the crowd and throw open the chest to reveal the gold $SOCIETY to a collective gasp and then loud cheer. A lot of apes have never seen what 50k $SOCIETY looks like! The crowd lets loose another loud cheer as Bradford makes his way out of the loaded cart. Hopping up on the cart to be seen and heard better, Bradford addresses the crowd:&#x20;

“This Amphitheatre is a landmark that will tell our story through its glory. Song, dance, speeches, and battle will entertain our families for centuries. This donation helps ensure that the history we leave behind a legacy of greatness.”&#x20;

“The Ventucci merchants have brought the supplies needed to build our dream. Their materials have provided an amazing opportunity for us to utilize our talent and build something special. I take pride in every art piece that I do, so I ask you that are involved in the construction, to take pride in building this landmark. I foresee the Golden Age returning to the Ape Society. I see us sharing our talents with all of Goguen and beyond. I make this donation in the name of the Rich family and artists everywhere. Thank you Maester Mars. Thank you, Royal Advisors and Merchants. Thank you, citizen, for pushing the narrative. $50k is no small amount, but it is just the beginning of my contributions to this city!”
