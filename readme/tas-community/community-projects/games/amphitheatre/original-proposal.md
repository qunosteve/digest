## **Disclaimer**

**Warning, what you are about to read is intended for fun.** It exists primarily to provide a spark to pique our imaginations in ways where we can bring more immersion and utility to the world of The Ape Society.

By voting on this proposal, you are merely showing an interest in ideas and elements defined below and it does not obligate Ape Force One to build this as it would be an extremely ambitious undertaking and they already have a lot on their plate.

Concepts in this proposal are not set in stone and are just suggestions on what & how to implement.

## **Amphitheatre Proposal Summary**

Every society needs entertainment. In order for The Ape Society to keep their sophistication in balance, every once in a while an ape needs to let loose.

This is why members of Ape Society have come together to propose the construction of an Amphitheatre, where the entire Ape Society and even the greater Cardano community can congregate for entertainment.

More specifically, members of the Ape Society can choose to participate in arena combat tournaments (and putting up a stake to try to predict the outcome of battles for a chance win more $SOCIETY), streaming of real-life live events such as music concerts, sports events, and/or movie premiers from real artists or real athletes in the future as this digital venue becomes more popular.

To participate in the events inside the Amphitheatre, audience members will have to pay an admittance fee of $SOCIETY tokens. Also Chevaliers (sponsors) will have to pay $SOCIETY to register their team of fighters into the tournament to have an opportunity to compete with other Chevaliers to earn $SOCIETY as they advance through the tournament. But that’s just the beginning..

### **Amphitheatre Utility 1: Arena Tournaments**

#### **Teams**:

Apes who volunteer to compete in the arena are titled arena fighters. Arena fighters are organized into teams. Every team requires the sponsorship of a Chevalier (Noble). The Chevalier is responsible for dispersing $SOCIETY winnings to the team at the end of the tournament.

Each Chevalier must purchase a custom sigil created by an artist. This sigil lets the audience know which fighter belongs on which team during combat. The Sigil is also displayed in the tournament bracket.

Besides a Chevalier, every team is required to have at least 1 military officer to maintain discipline and 1 artist to livestream. This requirement is explained in the class utility breakdown of this proposal.

#### **Gear and Horses**:

Arena gear is crafted by craftsmen. Teams can use any weapon except for firearms. Horses can be bred by explorers for the arena to be used as well.

If a fighter contains an eligible weapon or armor trait in their metadata, or if an ape in the same wallet contains an eligible weapon in their metadata, the fighter can use that weapon in their loadout.

Additionally, a responsible Chevalier will have extra gear and horses in their wallet to help supply their team with the appropriate weapons that are required for different arena scenarios. Fighters can equip items from their Chevalier’s wallet in the arena.

Losing teams also have to forfeit 1 horse or piece of gear to the winning team. The winning team chooses the item to loot.

### **Amphitheatre Utility 2: Gamification of Chance**

Apes are a bunch who love to participate and speculate on card games, horse races, and many other forms of activities that involve chance, especially if it can earn them more $SOCIETY. In between arena matches, apes like to stay occupied with these games for the chance of earning more $SOCIETY.

Additionally, Amphitheatre audience members can choose to participate in arena matches with their $SOCIETY token by attempting to predict the outcome of arena matches. They can do this by putting their stake of $SOCIETY into a staking line set up by the Staking Manager. If an ape’s arena match outcome prediction is true, the arena pays them their $SOCIETY back plus a reward (reward is based on odds set in the staking line).

### **Amphitheatre Utility 3: Real World Events**

As the Ape Society’s Amphitheatre gains popularity as a leading presence in the Cardano metaverse, the Amphitheatre’s virtual and social presence can be utilized as a venue to host in real world events. Performers and entertainers can be paid in $SOCIETY from admissions.

For example, musicians can host virtual concerts in the Amphitheatre. Up and coming film producers can choose to premier their movies as a stream in the Amphitheatre. Even certain sports, e-sports leagues, or motivational speakers can stream exclusively at the Amphitheatre to earn $SOCIETY.

During these real world events, virtual booths can be rented out by Merchants to 3rd party NFT marketplaces, merchandise stores, and any other companies looking for new customers to get familiarized with their product.

**\*Opinion:** We shouldn’t limit admittance to the Amphitheatre to just apes. Let’s open it up to any Cardano metaverse participant (maybe wandering in from Pavia, for example). As long as they pay in $SOCIETY, they can be in attendance.

## **Amphitheatre Class Utility breakdown**

### **Craftsmen**

Craftsmen can craft weapons, shields and armor to sell to fighters and Chevaliers for $SOCIETY. Maximum supply would ideally be philosophically identical to frames, but can be discussed more in depth at a later time as we get closer to implementation.

Years of manual labor give craftsmen bonuses in athletics in the arena.

### **Artists**

Entertaining is an artist’s specialty. Events in the Amphitheatre present limitless opportunities for artists to earn $SOCIETY. Every must use a sigil. Artists who have graphic design skills can paint & mint sigils and sell them for $SOCIETY to Chevaliers to visually represent their team in the arena and the online tournament bracket.

Every team requires an artist. From the arena, team artists serve the essential job of livestreaming their team’s point of view to the audience. Entrepreneurial artists could set up a tip feature on their stream to earn more $SOCIETY.

Announcers, who are appointed by administrators, are in charge of announcing and commentating matches. Successful Announcers immerse the tournament audience in the arena experience. They are paid 2% of admissions, but can earn up to an additional 1.5% bonus if their performance appeases the king who oversees the tournament. Tell your favorite Twitter space host or Youtuber with a radio voice about this role so they can go pick up an ape in the artist class before prices get too high!

For what it’s worth, artists receive bonuses in charm when fighting in the arena.

### **Explorers**

Every explorer needs horses for their expeditions. Buying horses gets expensive, so entrepreneurial explorers choose to breed horses instead and sell to fellow apes and chevaliers for $SOCIETY. But how does breeding work?

When explorers explore distant lands, they do what we call “asynchronous Cardano project collaboration”. More specifically, they acquire assets from another project to use in our ecosystem. In this case, they acquire horses from the world of “Equine”. Once per epoch, an explorer can mate a colt and filly Equine horse, and an Arena compatible horse is born with inherited but random traits based on the parents.

Additionally, explorers sometimes encounter legendary items in their travels. Explorers have a chance of being airdropped pieces of higher tier arena gear to keep or sell. Also rumors swirl that explorers who claim a higher diversity of approved projects’ land plots get these airdrops more frequently.

As seasoned travelers, explorers receive bonuses in riding in the arena.

### **Merchants**

Merchants can make $SOCIETY in the Amphitheatre in two ways:

They can rent booths in the Amphitheatre to sell items for $SOCIETY or $ADA. This could include integrations to NFT marketplaces (for example, an entity like JPG.store will need to hold a merchant to set up a booth).

Staking managers, who are appointed by administrators, can use the staking budget (4% of admissions) to research certain teams’ odds of winning to set up staking lines, etc. Staking managers get paid 50% of what’s left of the staking budget at the end of the tournament (including profits), and give the other half to the Amphitheatre’s home district.

Merchants receive bonuses in roguery in the arena, as cunning as they are.

### **Military Officers**

To maintain discipline and decorum, tournament rules mandate that every team requires at least one military officer, or be disqualified. Also, military Officers’ expertise in combat allows them to be extremely proficient in the arena. As the only class that has actual combat experience, they enjoy an abundance of a combat skill boosts in the arena.

Officers have another opportunity to earn $SOCIETY. Their discipline is needed to uphold the integrity of the tournament. The administrator appoints Officers as Arbiters for each arena match. The Arbiter is the only ape who is allowed to wield a firearm in the arena. The Arbiter is authorized to settle disputes and/or issue ejections for dishonorable behavior or non-compliance. The Arbiter is authorized to discharge their firearm to enforce these ejections if necessary. Each arbiter gets paid 10% of the winnings for each match.

Military Officers are the masters of the arena. They receive bonuses in Athletics, Riding, Leadership, and Tactics when fighting in the arena.

### **Royal Advisors**

Every tournament, Royal Advisors can apply to be the “Arena Administrator” but only 1 is selected at random. The Administrator has the most responsibility in ensuring a successful tournament. Any tournament responsibilities not explicitly covered in this proposal fall on the Administrator to handle. Administrators get 4% of all attendance revenue, and up to 3% more in bonus $SOCIETY if the King gives them a good rating.

Responsibilities:\
\- Scheduling a date & time for the tournament that works for everyone.\
\- Authority to appoint, match Arbiters, Staking Manager, & 2 Announcers\
\- Update the tournament bracket as the tournament progresses.\
\- They select the winning Chevalier address after each battle

Royal Advisors receive bonuses in tactics when fighting in the arena.

### **Nobles**

In the Amphitheatre, Nobles serve as Chevaliers (pronounced “shoo-vuh-lee-ay”) Chevaliers are the captain of a team of fighters. As the team wins matches, the Chevalier gets paid in $SOCIETY. Tournament rules mandate that every team requires a Chevalier or the team faces disqualification.

The Chevalier’s responsibility is to collect a roster of names and stake addresses of all team members to provide to the Administrator of the tournament. It is their responsibility to pay their team’s admission fee into the tournament. Larger teams = larger admissions fees.

If a team wins the entire tournament, a trophy is minted and given to the Chevalier to be displayed at their cabin.

Nobles & Kings receive bonuses in Leadership and Medicine in the arena.

### **Kings**

In the same way Administrators are randomly selected, a King applies and is randomly selected to oversee the tournament. Their pay is an uncontested 7% of attendance revenue. The overseer’s responsibility is to ensure the audience has a delightful experience. They enforce this by grading the performance of the administrator and announcers. Their evaluation determines how much bonus $SOCIETY is distributed at the end of the tournament.

Kings can re-qualify one team per tournament if the team is beat in a match. If that team goes all the way to win the entire tournament, the king is owed half of $SOCIETY winnings from that team’s final round (5% of attendance revenue).

Finally, at the end of the tournament, a King chooses their favorite fighter on the winning team to be deemed as the tournament’s champion. The champion receives a trophy that can be displayed in their cabin. They also receive any remaining bonus $SOCIETY that the king refused to give to the appointed staff.

Kings can fill in as Chevaliers if there are less than 64 teams in the tourney.

### **Cabin Owners in the Amphitheatre’s District**

The Amphitheatre not only exists to provide entertainment to the Cardano community and utility to Ape Society apes. The Amphitheatre also provides appreciation to cabin owners in its home district.

25% of admissions + 50% of stake line profits are set aside to pay cabin owners in the Amphitheatre’s home district after every tournament:

* 34% divided and distributed to all Chateaus in the district
* 33% divided and distributed to all Estates in the district
* 33% divided and distributed to all Cottages in the district

## **Costs:**

The Majority of the costs will come from the manpower required from building the mechanics described in the proposal. Work that would be needed would be smart contract programming, video game modding, and server operation. Technical details are laid out in the roadmap section.

It is recommended that we see what kind of talent we have in the community. For example, our stakepool operators in the TASPI have experience in running servers. As we build and test we can lean on their skills; however, as participation begins to grow to the hundreds or thousands we would probably need to look at more serious hosting services.

Once we get everything built, everything should be self-sustaining. The costs of actually administering the tournament all comes from participants and is laid out on page 14 of the PDF version of the proposal (next page if you’re already on the pdf).

## **Benefits to DAO & Individual Members\***

The utility, competitiveness, and the experience that the Amphitheatre landmark will bring will increase the intrinsic value of Ape Society. By establishing a venue in the Cardano “metaverse”, we might open the doors to opportunities and collaborations we haven’t even dreamed about.

It benefits Apes by introducing “play-to-earn” and “stake-to-earn” mechanics that increase the immersion and excitement of being an Ape. Also, it sets a precedent in establishing a revenue stream to cabins in the landmark’s home district.

## **Risks & Concerns\***

The biggest risk is the complexity and level of effort this is going to take to implement. No one has attempted to do anything close to this level of utility and immersion. However, because no one has done and it’s “hard”, does it mean we shouldn’t do it? We chose to use and build on Cardano for a reason, as Cardano was built the innovators/changemakers.

The Ape Society has an opportunity to emerge as a cultural juggernaut, not just for Cardano but for ALL blockchains. How do we begin? We can mitigate the complexity to implement the utility of this proposal by dividing this proposal into “phases” as outlined in the roadmap section on the next page.

The way this is written, our imagination probably takes us to a 3d arena with hundreds of people walking around the Amphitheatre like Cardano Summit 2021 when people could walk around freely and converse while watching a live video stream in the center stage.
