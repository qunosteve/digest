The Amphitheatre Blueprint token is an alternate token that can be earned via bounties to unlock blueprints beyond the "soft cap" of blueprint sponsorships and can be used to upgrade existing sponsorships. \
\
It is a native fungible token on Cardano, so it can be traded/sent/etc with Cardano wallets or via any dApp that supports it. If you want to read up on how to earn it, please see [bounty-structure.md](bounty-structure.md "mention")

## How The Amphitheatre Project Uses the Blueprint token:

1. Ape can earn Blueprint Tokens by completing bounties. \

2. Like SOCIETY Token, Blueprint tokens count towards Upgrading "D" Class sponsorships (see below).\

3. Blueprint tokens have exclusive privileges over SOCIETY. If an Ape accumulates enough blueprint tokens (10k, 50k, 250, 1m), they can purchase an "E" class blueprint certificate for any blueprint slot that hasn't reached the "Hard Cap" of 5 blueprints per gear slot yet. Below is a screenshot of the current gear slot blueprint counts as of this writing.\

4. Blueprint tokens can also be used to to upgrade "E" class sponsorships. This is another exclusive perk for blueprint tokens users. \

5. Once the Amphitheatre wallet has received the blueprint tokens for an "E" class sponsorship or to upgrade a "D" or "E" class sponsorship, and once the stewardship processes the issuance/upgrade of the desired blueprint/certificate, those blueprint tokens are then burned out of circulation as they have fulfilled their purpose.

\
\
\*Note: E Class certificates and D Class certificates have the same individual perks outlined in the [sponsorship-structure.md](sponsorship-structure.md "mention") , the only difference is how they are earned/unlocked.
