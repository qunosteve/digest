### Wake up Denton Hill

There once was an ape named Denton hill who liked to sail the open seas. Blade in his mouth he was armed to the teeth but he fell into a dream.

Wake up Denton Hill, they’re staking you against your will. Wake up Denton Hill before your whiskey spills.

They say you can find a wall full of plots in his cabin in Doork East. Some say those sketches are of destinations from his dreams.

Wake up Denton Hill, they’re staking you against your will. Wake up Denton Hill you don’t want to miss a thrill.

One night he had to steer the ship but instead dozed off to bed. Captain woke to the ship run aground and said OFF WITH HIS HEAD!

Wake up Denton Hill, they’re staking you against your will. Wake up Denton Hill there’s a bounty to fulfill.

They chased him to the end of the world till they began to bore. But as they were leaving they started hearing Denton in a snore.

Wake up Denton Hill, they’re staking you against your will Wake up Denton Hill, they want your blood to spill.

There once was an ape named Denton Hill who sailed the open seas. With a blade in his mouth…how did this go South? Then he woke up from his dream.

Wake up Denton Hill, they’re staking you against your will. Wake up Denton Hill, come get your whiskey filled. Stay still Denton Hill, I’m staking you against your will. Stay still Denton Hill, your frame is payin the bill.
