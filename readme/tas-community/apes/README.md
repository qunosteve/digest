# Apes

## Ape Names

This is the very first project on Cardano to have **named** NFTs. Each NFT has its own unique name in the form of a first name and a last name. This is because each ape belongs to one of 35 families.&#x20;

### Families

Each family represents a last name for an ape. There are a total of 35 families each belonging to a class. Your class informs how rare your last name is. For instance, at the very bottom of the pyramid are the craftsmen. The most essential class in the society, however they are also the most abundant. Last names belonging to this class are less rare than a last name belonging to a higher class, like the merchants. Each class has its own unique role to play in the economy of the society.&#x20;
