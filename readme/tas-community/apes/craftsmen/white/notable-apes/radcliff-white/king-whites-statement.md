# King White's Statement

## The generous King Radcliff White marks his claim and establishes a collaboration

**King Radcliff White** enjoys his summers in his secondary residence Doork East but like every hard working craftsmen there is a time to get back to work and build substance in the ecosystem. Rad has completed his trek and has ended up in his primary home district. It is a district where all residents are prideful to call it their home and all members are driven to be active and valuable members not only in the district but also within the entire ape society ecosystem. Its always been the great north district 1 of Heolt. Some call it The North others refer to it as HE. But this is a place where the White family of apes will reside. But it is not exclusive to only white family apes. It will be a craftsmen haven built on the same beliefs of working hard to do your part to grow this community. We welcome all. King Radcliff White would like to encourage all to find homestead in district 1 and here is why.&#x20;

### Family Fund from Warhammer Royalties

After King Radcliffe donation of 250k society to the amphitheater he structured a deal that all those holding a white family ape with get 50% off admissions cost every time entering the amphitheater. Radcliff White will receive 80% perpetuity on every “Slick” Warhammer purchased in the amphitheater. Rad has decided to take at least 10% of that perpetuity to go directly into the White Family Ape fund under the wallet $heolt. For the first two years the society accumulated within that wallet will be distributed to qualifying community members and split equally into a bonus for those that qualify to be dispersed at the year end. After those 2 years the community of WFA will decide if they want to continue said dispersal or branch into investing or charity work with those funds.&#x20;

#### Qualifying members for this distribution:&#x20;

<mark style="color:blue;"><mark style="color:green;">1. Hold a white family ape.<mark style="color:green;"></mark> \ <mark style="color:blue;"><mark style="color:green;">2. Staking that white family ape for at least 6 months.<mark style="color:green;"></mark> \ <mark style="color:blue;"><mark style="color:green;">3. Hold a cabin in Heolt.<mark style="color:green;"></mark>&#x20;

Those that fulfill all these qualifications will receive equal share of the society accumulated from the Warhammer perp play at the end of the year.&#x20;

### Ghostchain Staking Perk

So what if I don’t have a white family ape people may say. Im going to add another interesting layer. Most of you know that I have two loves in this space. Ape Society and Ghostchain. TAS recently partnered with [flipr.io](http://flipr.io/) which is being created by the Ghostchain team. It is a new decentralized nft hub and marketplace where the net profit share goes to ghostchain holders. As a large holder I want to make sure I share the success of [flipr.io](http://flipr.io/) so I pledge 10% of the net profit share I receive from [flipr.io](http://flipr.io/) will be equally distributed to people that **meet these requirements:**

<mark style="color:green;">1. Hold any ape society family.</mark> \ <mark style="color:green;">2. Hold a cabin in Heolt (district 1).</mark> \ <mark style="color:green;">3. Hold and stake one ghostchain nft in your Heolt cabin.</mark>&#x20;

I want to encourage all to use [flipr.io](http://flipr.io/) and hopefully we all share in its success. Please remember invest in these things because you can afford to and because you want too. I am trying to have fun creating utility within Radcliff Whites family. There is a chance none of the plays above are successful. I hope that we can all ensure that they are a success. I will always be transparent and I will always be trying to help grow all of Ape Society. I hope we all have success in this project beyond anything we can dream up.&#x20;

I leave you with this. Be grateful for our devs. Thank them. Be kind to others. True leaders don’t say to others hey look I’m leading. Know the path and grab as many as you can for the ride. Stay well.
