# Smith Family Museum

The carts were piling up outside the majestic building. Apes from the far reaches of the city had all come to witness the grand opening of this momentous beacon. Kings, De`Medici`s and the Royal advisors had been granted VIP tickets. Their majestic carriages were guided through a guarded entrance, and valet apes would make sure all the wagons were effectively parked in the neat and tidy garden out back. The lower families had to get in line though. There was a first come, first serve policy for the less privileged of apes. Some of the more curious and tenacious apes had set up camp outside the building as much as a week before the grand opening. Tents, bonfires, and hammocks could be seen lined up closest to the entrance. A couple of apes had even managed to do their laundry while waiting for the grand opening. Everything from socks to doublets were hanging out to dry in the sunny weather. Of course the procrastinators would come last. The queue was long, and they had a few hours of lining up before they would be able to witness the marvels inside the building.

What was all the fuss about? Well, the ever ambitious Smith family had gathered their most talented Master Craftsmen to build a spectacular specimen of each craftable item. Only the most immaculate of items would be accepted. After close scrutiny by the most senior members of the family and a final stamp of approval by King Harvey Smith himself, the masterpieces would be taken to the building and placed in glass display cases. The members of the Smith family who had crafted the objects would be lauded by the family and would receive praise and accolades from their peers.

The writing on the wall of the building read “Smith Family Museum” It was an impressive sight. Smith inspired art adorned the stone façade. Busts, sculptures, statues, and grotesques had been carved out in the likeness of the Smith Master Craftsmen and placed in strategic positions around the museum. 25 statues signify the 25 Masters, each responsible for marvels unheard of in the crafting circles.

As the courtyard in front of the museum had completely filled up, a fanfare could be heard from the main entrance of the building. It was finally time for the grand opening. Smith apes had lined up outside the main doors in their finest outfits and a red carpet was being rolled down the stairs to the yard. A short while after the fanfare, two Smith apes with shining top hats would gracefully open the front doors. On the step inside, King Harvey Smith stood with a proud look on his face. He would nod and waive to the bystanders as he walked down the stairs on the red carpet. Before he reached the base of the stairs he would stop and raise his hands to quiet the large crowd of apes gathered in the yard.

After some time the ruckus from the crowd died down and King Smith would speak. “Dear Smith apes, dear apes of the Society. It is with pride and admiration for my fellow Smith family that I am today able to open this magnificent Smith Family Museum to the masses. As you all are aware, the Master Craftsmen from the Smith family are capable of making some of the finest wares available. With this Museum we aim to show off the very best of all crated items. One of each craftable item will be displayed here for all to enjoy. This is testament to the ingenuity and the skills of our beloved family. We call it a Smith made family first initiative or SMIFFI. All current and future items that are craftable will be displayed in this museum. Only the very best and most magnificent of crafts will be shown, and only Smith apes will be eligible to display them. So, I say to all the visiting apes, come in, enjoy the sight of perfection. Marvel in the splendor that is Smith crafts and soak in the wonders of our family effort. With this I now declare the Museum open for the masses.”

King Smith would step aside, and the crowd roared in anticipation for the grand opening. Shortly after, a myriad of apes would enter the main building and finally be able to see the pristine art of the Smith craftsmen.
