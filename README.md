# The Ape Society Digest

## What is The Ape Society?

TAS is a collection of 7,000 NFTs that form one of the biggest community-based DAOs in the Cardano ecosystem, creating an ideal aristocratic society with many family tiers and unique names. We aim to support builders, evangelists, and those with creative ideas that can push the entire community forward.

The Ape Society is divided into 35 families, each with its own crest and relative lore, which in addition to a number of traits, dictates the rarity of the NFT. The Apes are at the center of the ecosystem and allow you to earn a number of rewards through frames.\

We are the Web3 country club, the one-stop-shop for all NFT and DeFi enthusiasts. \

The core TAS team maintains an official litepaper that contains more info about the official development of The Ape Society here:

## But What is The Ape Society Digest?

The Ape Society Digest is a directory of information that specifically covers the DAO and Community of the Ape Society.

### Why a separate Catalogue of information?

The Ape Society DAO is an entity that consists of Ape Society community members with its own initiatives, legal structure, and treasury that is separate from to AF1 (Ape Force One, the core dev team of Ape Society). This digest catalogues the TAS DAO structure as well as TAS community contributions and information. This registry of information has become a necessity as the Ape Society community is a busy bunch who use their Ape Society branding to launch various projects, lore, personalities, books, and much more.\
