# The Ape Society Digest

The Ape Society is an art first metaverse second project that is being developed on the Cardano blockchain. The project delivers quality art to its holders in the form of ape pfps, but also adds entirely novel concepts to the world of nfts. Concepts such as a gamified virtual economy, first and last names, a class structure and perks pertaining to each class. At The Ape Society, your pfp doesn't just act as your profile picture, it is your key to access the fully encompassing system behind The Ape Society project

## Apes

Apes are the starting point for The Ape Society project. The ape pfp was designed by an award winning art studio, one that has received recognition for their work in VR. The brush stroke detail on the apes design are one the firsts seen in the Cardano NFT space. The apes renaissance style mixed with modern age accessories leave a good mix of the old world and new.

## $SOCIETY

Those with the gold, make the rules! :moneybag:

The Society token is the final cog in The Ape Society project, it is the glue that makes the gamified virtual economy a reality. It is the token that will enable trade between individuals, upgrading frames, buying assets for your cabin, and other functions yet to be disclosed. The Society token is deflationary meaning that it gets more valuable over time provided it is used. This is due to its fixed supply of 700 million tokens, and its burn mechanism tied to frames.
